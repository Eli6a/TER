CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT

 No. 14–1055. Argued November 8, 2016—Decided January 18, 2017
The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) is a federally
  chartered corporation that participates in the secondary mortgage
  market. By statute, Fannie Mae has the power “to sue and to be
  sued, and to complain and to defend, in any court of competent juris-
  diction, State or Federal.” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">12</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §1723a(a). When petitioners
  Beverly Ann Hollis-Arrington and her daughter Crystal Lightfoot
  filed suit in state court alleging deficiencies in the refinancing, fore-
  closure, and sale of their home, Fannie Mae removed the case to fed-
  eral court, relying on its sue-and-be-sued clause as the basis for ju-
  risdiction. The District Court denied a motion to remand the case to
  state court and later entered judgment against petitioners. The
  Ninth Circuit affirmed. In concluding that the District Court had ju-
  risdiction under Fannie Mae’s sue-and-be-sued clause, the court re-
  lied on American Nat. Red Cross v. S. G., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112770"><a href="/opinion/112770/american-nat-red-cross-v-sg/"><span class="volume">505</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">247</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, which it read
  as establishing a rule that when a sue-and-be-sued clause in a federal
  charter expressly authorizes suit in federal court, it confers jurisdic-
  tion on the federal courts.

 courts jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae. Pp. 6–16.

    decisions “support the rule that a congressional charter’s ‘sue and be

    only if, it specifically mentions the federal courts,” </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112770"><a href="/opinion/112770/american-nat-red-cross-v-sg/"><span class="id_token">id.,</span> at 255.
</a></span><pre class="inline">       In specifically mentioning the federal courts, Fannie Mae’s sue-
    and-be-sued clause resembles the three clauses this Court has held
    confer jurisdiction. But unlike those clauses, Fannie Mae’s clause
    adds the qualification “any court of competent jurisdiction,” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">12</span>
<span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §1723a(a). Thus, the outcome here turns on the meaning of
    “court of competent jurisdiction.”
       A court of competent jurisdiction is a court with the power to adju-
    dicate the case before it, Black’s Law Dictionary 431, and a court’s
    subject-matter jurisdiction defines its power to hear cases, see Steel
    Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="2620886"><a href="/opinion/2620886/steel-co-v-citizens-for-better-environment/"><span class="volume">523</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">83</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 89. It follows
    that a court of competent jurisdiction is a court with a grant of sub-
    ject-matter jurisdiction covering the case before it. This Court has
    understood that phrase as a reference to a court with an existing
    source of subject-matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., Ex parte Phenix Ins.
    Co., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="91719"><a href="/opinion/91719/ex-parte-phenix-insurance-company/"><span class="volume">118</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">610</span></a></span><pre class="inline">. On this understanding, Fannie Mae’s sue-and-be-
    sued clause is most naturally read not to grant federal courts subject-
    matter jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae but to permit
    suit in any state or federal court already endowed with subject-
    matter jurisdiction.
       Red Cross does not require a different result. It did not set out a
    rule that an express reference to the federal courts suffices to make a
    sue-and-be-sued clause a grant of federal jurisdiction. Rather, it re-
    stated “the basic rule” of Deveaux and Osborn that a sue-and-be-sued
    clause conferring only a general right to sue does not grant jurisdic-
    tion to the federal </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112770"><span class="antecedent_guess">courts.</span> <a href="/opinion/112770/american-nat-red-cross-v-sg/"><span class="volume">505</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>, at <span class="page">253</span></a></span><pre class="inline">. Pp. 6–11.
       (b) Fannie Mae’s arguments against reading its sue-and-be-sued
    clause as merely capacity conferring are unpersuasive. Its alterna-
    tive readings of “court of competent jurisdiction” are premised on the
    already rejected reading of Red Cross. The prior construction canon
    of statutory interpretation does not apply because none of the cases
    on which Fannie Mae relies suggest that Congress in 1954 would
    have surveyed the jurisprudential landscape and necessarily con-
    cluded that the courts had already settled the question whether a
    sue-and-be-sued clause containing the phrase “court of competent ju-
    risdiction” confers jurisdiction on the federal courts. Finally, Fannie
    Mae’s appeals to congressional purpose do not call into question the
    plain text reading of its sue-and-be-sued clause. Pp. 11–16.

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                              [January 18, 2017]


   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
   The corporate charter of the Federal National Mortgage
Association, known as Fannie Mae, authorizes Fannie
Mae “to sue and to be sued, and to complain and to defend,
in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.”
</pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">12</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §1723a(a). This case presents the question
whether this sue-and-be-sued clause grants federal dis-
trict courts jurisdiction over cases involving Fannie Mae.
We hold that it does not.

                           A

  During the Great Depression, the Federal Government
worked to stabilize and strengthen the residential mort-
gage market. Among other things, it took steps to in-
crease liquidity (reasonably available funding) in the
mortgage market. These efforts included the creation of
the Federal Home Loan Banks, which provide credit to
member institutions to finance affordable housing and
economic development projects, and the Federal Housing
Administration (FHA), which insures residential mort-
2        LIGHTFOOT v. CENDANT MORTGAGE CORP.

                     Opinion of the Court

gages. See Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, Back-
ground and History of the Federal National Mortgage
Association 1–7, A4 (1966).
    Also as part of these efforts, Title III of the National
Housing Act (1934 Act) authorized the Administrator of
the newly created FHA to establish “national mortgage
associations” that could “purchase and sell [certain] first
mortgages and such other first liens” and “borrow money
for such purposes.” §301(a), 48 Stat. 1252–1253. The
associations were endowed with certain powers, including
the power to “sue and be sued, complain and defend, in
any court of law or equity, State or Federal.” §301(c), </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="id_token">id.,</span>
at 1253.
</span><pre class="inline">    In 1938, the FHA Administrator exercised that author-
ity and chartered the Federal National Mortgage Associa-
tion. Avoiding a mouthful of an acronym (FNMA), it went
by Fannie Mae. See, e.g., Washington Post, July 14, 1940,
p. P2 (“ ‘Fanny May’ ”); N. Y. Times, Mar. 23, 1950, p. 48
(“ ‘Fannie Mae’ ”). As originally chartered, Fannie Mae
was wholly owned by the Federal Government and had
three objectives: to “establish a market for [FHA-insured]
first mortgages” covering new housing construction, to
“facilitate the construction and financing of economically
sound rental housing projects,” and to “make [the bonds it
issued] available to . . . investors.” Fed. Nat. Mortgage
Assn. Information Regarding the Activities of the Assn. 1
(Circular No. 1, 1938).
    Fannie Mae was rechartered in 1954. Housing Act of
1954 (1954 Act), §201, 68 Stat. 613. No longer wholly
Government owned, Fannie Mae had mixed ownership:
Private shareholders held its common stock and the De-
partment of the Treasury held its preferred stock. The
1954 Act required the Secretary of the Treasury to allow
Fannie Mae to repurchase that stock. See </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="id_token">id.,</span> at 613–615.
</span><pre class="inline">It expected that Fannie Mae would repurchase all of its
preferred stock and that legislation would then be enacted

                      Opinion of the Court

to turn Fannie Mae over to the private stockholders.
From then on, Fannie Mae’s duties would “be carried out
by a privately owned and privately financed corporation.”
</pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="id_token">Id.,</span> at 615. </span><pre class="inline">Along with these structural changes, the 1954
Act replaced Fannie Mae’s initial set of powers with a
more detailed list. In doing so, it revised the sue-and-be-
sued clause to give Fannie Mae the power “to sue and to
be sued, and to complain and to defend, in any court of
competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="id_token">Id.,</span> at 620.
</span><pre class="inline">  In 1968, Fannie Mae became fully privately owned and
relinquished part of its portfolio to its new spinoff, the
Government National Mortgage Association (known as
Ginnie Mae). See Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 (1968 Act), 82 Stat. 536. Fannie Mae “continue[d] to
operate the secondary market operations” but became “a
Government-sponsored private corporation.” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">12</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">.
§1716b. Ginnie Mae “remain[ed] in the Government” and
took over “the special assistance functions and manage-
ment and liquidating functions.” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="ibid_token">Ibid.</span> Ginnie Mae re-
</span><pre class="inline">ceived the same set of powers as Fannie Mae. See
§1723(a); see also 1968 Act, §802(z), 82 Stat. 540 (minor
revisions to §1723a(a)).
  This general structure remains in place. Fannie Mae
continues to participate in the secondary mortgage mar-
ket. It purchases mortgages that meet its eligibility criteria,
packages them into mortgage-backed securities, and sells
those securities to investors, and it invests in mortgage-
backed securities itself. One of those mortgage purchases
led to Fannie Mae’s entanglement in this case.
                           B
  Beverly Ann Hollis-Arrington refinanced her mortgage
with Cendant Mortgage Corporation (Cendant) in the
summer of 1999. Fannie Mae then bought the mortgage,
while Cendant continued to service it. Unable to make her
payments, Hollis-Arrington pursued a forbearance ar-
4         LIGHTFOOT v. CENDANT MORTGAGE CORP.

                      Opinion of the Court

rangement with Cendant. No agreement materialized,
and the home entered foreclosure. Around this time,
Cendant repurchased the mortgage from Fannie Mae
because it did not meet Fannie Mae’s credit standards.
   To stave off the foreclosure, Hollis-Arrington and her
daughter, Crystal Lightfoot, pursued bankruptcy and
transferred the property between themselves. These ef-
forts failed, and the home was sold at a trustee’s sale in
2001. The two then took to the courts to try to undo the
foreclosure and sale.
   After two unsuccessful federal suits, the pair filed this
suit in state court. They alleged that deficiencies in the
refinancing, foreclosure, and sale of their home entitled
them to relief against Fannie Mae. Their claims against
other defendants are not relevant here.
   Fannie Mae removed the case to federal court under </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">28</span>
<span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §1441(a), which permits a defendant to remove
from state to federal court “any civil action” over which the
federal district courts “have original jurisdiction.” It relied
on its sue-and-be-sued clause as the basis for jurisdiction.
The District Court denied a motion to remand the case to
state court.
   The District Court then dismissed the claims against
Fannie Mae on claim preclusion grounds. After a series of
motions, rulings, and appeals not related to the issue
here, the District Court entered final judgment. Hollis-
Arrington and Lightfoot immediately moved to set aside
the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b),
alleging “fraud upon the court.” App. 95–110. The Dis-
trict Court denied the motion.
   The Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the case and
the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion. 465 Fed. Appx. 668
(2012). After Hollis-Arrington and Lightfoot sought re-
hearing, the Ninth Circuit withdrew its opinion and or-
dered briefing on the question whether the District Court
had jurisdiction over the case under Fannie Mae’s sue-

   A divided panel affirmed the District Court’s judgment.
The majority relied on American Nat. Red Cross v. S. G.,
</pre><span class="citation" data-id="112770"><a href="/opinion/112770/american-nat-red-cross-v-sg/"><span class="volume">505</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">247</span> </a></span><pre class="inline">(1992). It read that decision to have estab-
lished a “rule [that] resolves this case”: When a sue-and-
be-sued clause in a federal charter expressly authorizes
suit in federal courts, it confers jurisdiction on the federal
</pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="antecedent_guess">courts.</span> <span class="volume">769</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span>, at <span class="page">684</span></span><pre class="inline">. The dissent instead read Red
Cross as setting out only a “ ‘default rule’ ” that provides a
“starting point for [the] </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="antecedent_guess">analysis.”</span> <span class="volume">769</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span>, at <span class="page">692</span> </span><pre class="inline">(opin-
ion of Stein, J.). It read “any court of competent jurisdic-
tion” in Fannie Mae’s sue-and-be-sued clause to overcome
that default rule by requiring an independent source for
jurisdiction in cases involving Fannie Mae. </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="ibid_token">Ibid.</span>

court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">12</span>

this language serves the uncontroversial function of clari-
fying Fannie Mae’s capacity to bring suit and to be sued.
See Bank of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 85–86
(1809). The question here is whether Fannie Mae’s sue-
and-be-sued clause goes further and grants federal courts
jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae.

This Court has ad-
dressed the jurisdictional reach of sue-and-be-sued clauses
in five federal charters. Three clauses were held to grant
jurisdiction, while two were found wanting.
    The first discussion of sue-and-be-sued clauses came in
a pair of opinions by Chief Justice Marshall. The charter
of the first Bank of the United States allowed it “ ‘to sue
and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be
answered, defend and be defended, in courts of record, or
any other place whatsoever.’ ” Deveaux, 5 Cranch, at 85.
Another provision allowed suits in federal court against
certain bank officials, suggesting “the right to sue does not
imply a right to sue in the courts of the union, unless it be
expressed.” </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112770"><a href="/opinion/112770/american-nat-red-cross-v-sg/"><span class="id_token">Id.,</span> at 86. </a></span><pre class="inline">In light of this language, the Court

    A mortgage dispute </span><pre class="inline">between a railroad and its creditor
led to the next consideration of this issue. The Texas and
Pacific Railway Company’s federal charter authorized it
“ ‘to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, defend and

United States.’ ” Bankers Trust Co. v. Texas &amp; Pacific R.

to the next statement on this issue. The Federal Deposit

   Armed with these </span><pre class="inline">earlier cases, as synthesized by Red
Cross, we turn to the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue here.
                            B
  Fannie Mae’s sue-and-be-sued clause resembles the
clauses this Court has held confer jurisdiction in one
important respect. In authorizing Fannie Mae “to sue and
to be sued, and to complain and to defend, in any court of
competent jurisdiction, State or Federal,” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">12</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">.
§1723a(a), it “specifically mentions the federal courts.”
Red </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112770"><span class="antecedent_guess">Cross,</span> <a href="/opinion/112770/american-nat-red-cross-v-sg/"><span class="volume">505</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>, at <span class="page">255</span></a></span><pre class="inline">. This mention of the federal
courts means that Fannie Mae’s charter clears a hurdle
that the clauses in Deveaux and Bankers Trust did not.
  But Fannie Mae’s clause differs in a material respect
from the three clauses the Court has held sufficient to
                 Cite as: 580 U. S. ____ (2017)            9

                     Opinion of the Court

grant federal jurisdiction. Those clauses referred to suits
in the federal courts without qualification. In contrast,
Fannie Mae’s sue-and-be-sued clause refers to “any court
of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.” §1723a(a)
(emphasis added). Because this sue-and-be-sued clause is
not “in all relevant respects identical” to a clause already
held to grant federal jurisdiction, Red </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112770"><span class="antecedent_guess">Cross,</span> <a href="/opinion/112770/american-nat-red-cross-v-sg/"><span class="volume">505</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>, at
<span class="page">257</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, this case cannot be resolved by a simple comparison.
The outcome instead turns on the meaning of “court of
competent jurisdiction” in Fannie Mae’s sue-and-be-sued
clause.
   A court of competent jurisdiction is a court with the
power to adjudicate the case before it. See Black’s Law
Dictionary 431 (10th ed. 2014) (“[a] court that has the
power and authority to do a particular act; one recognized
by law as possessing the right to adjudicate a contro-
versy”). And a court’s subject-matter jurisdiction defines
its power to hear cases. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better
Environment, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="2620886"><a href="/opinion/2620886/steel-co-v-citizens-for-better-environment/"><span class="volume">523</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">83</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 89 (1998) (Subject-matter

(“Subject-matter jurisdiction . . . concerns a court’s compe-
tence to adjudicate a particular category of cases”). It
follows that a court of competent jurisdiction is a court
with a grant of subject-matter jurisdiction covering the
case before it. Cf. Pennoyer v. Neff, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="89656"><a href="/opinion/89656/pennoyer-v-neff/"><span class="volume">95</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">714</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 733
(1878) (“[T]here must be a tribunal competent by its con-
stitution—that is, by the law of its creation—to pass upon
the subject-matter of the suit”).
   As a result, this Court has understood the phrase “court
of competent jurisdiction” as a reference to a court with an
existing source of subject-matter jurisdiction. Ex parte
Phenix Ins. Co., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="91719"><a href="/opinion/91719/ex-parte-phenix-insurance-company/"><span class="volume">118</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">610</span> </a></span><pre class="inline">(1886), provides an example.
There, the Court explained that a statute “providing for

<span class="page">105</span></a></span><pre class="inline">. In noting that “the actual text . . . nowhere contains
an explicit grant of jurisdiction,” the Court pointed to two
clauses requiring “judicial review . . . to proceed ‘in a court
specified by statute’ or ‘in a court of competent jurisdic-
tion’ ” and stated that both “seem to look to outside sources
of jurisdictional authority.” </pre><span class="citation" data-id="109606"><a href="/opinion/109606/califano-v-sanders/"><span class="id_token">Id.,</span> at 105–106, </a></span><pre class="inline">and n. 6.
   On this understanding, Fannie Mae’s sue-and-be-sued
clause is most naturally read not to grant federal courts
subject-matter jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie
Mae. In authorizing Fannie Mae to sue and be sued “in
any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal,” it
permits suit in any state or federal court already endowed
with subject-matter jurisdiction over the suit.
                             C
  Red Cross does not require a different result. Some,
including the lower courts here, have understood it to set
out a rule that an express reference to the federal courts
suffices to make a sue-and-be-sued clause a grant of fed-
eral jurisdiction. Red Cross contains no such rule.
  By its own terms, the rule Red Cross restates is “the
basic rule” drawn in Deveaux and Osborn that a sue-and-
be-sued clause conferring only a general right to sue does

                         III
  Fannie Mae, preferring to be in federal court, raises
several arguments against reading its sue-and-be-
sued clause as merely capacity conferring. None are
persuasive.
12       LIGHTFOOT v. CENDANT MORTGAGE CORP.

                     Opinion of the Court 


                              A

   Fannie Mae first offers several alternative readings of
“court of competent jurisdiction.” It suggests that the
phrase might refer to a court with personal jurisdiction
over the parties before it, a court of proper venue, or a
court of general, rather than specialized, jurisdiction.
Brief for Respondents 41–45.
   At bottom, Fannie Mae’s efforts on this front are prem-
ised on the reading of Red Cross rejected above. In its
view, an express reference to the federal courts suffices to
confer subject-matter jurisdiction on federal courts. It
sees its only remaining task as explaining why that would
not render “court of competent jurisdiction” superfluous.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–30. But the fact that a sue-and-be-
sued clause references the federal courts does not resolve
the jurisdictional question. Thus, arguments as to why
the phrase “court of competent jurisdiction” could still
have meaning if it does not carry its ordinary meaning are
beside the point.
   Moreover, even if the phrase carries additional meaning,
that would not further Fannie Mae’s argument. Take its
suggestion that a “court of competent jurisdiction” is a
court with personal jurisdiction. A court must have the
power to decide the claim before it (subject-matter juris-
diction) and power over the parties before it (personal
jurisdiction) before it can resolve a case. See Ruhrgas AG
v. Marathon Oil Co., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="118288"><a href="/opinion/118288/ruhrgas-ag-v-marathon-oil-co/"><span class="volume">526</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">574</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 583–585 (1999). Rec-
ognizing as much, this Court has stated that the phrase
“court of competent jurisdiction,” while “usually used to
refer to subject-matter jurisdiction, has also been used on
occasion to refer to a court’s jurisdiction over the defend-

sue-and-be-sued clause suggests that the reference to

personal jurisdiction over the parties before it. At most
then, this point might support reading the phrase to refer
to both subject-matter and personal jurisdiction. That
does not help Fannie Mae. So long as the sue-and-be-sued
clause refers to an outside source of subject-matter juris-
diction, it does not confer subject-matter jurisdiction.
                              B
  Fannie Mae next claims that, by the time its sue-and-be-
sued clause was enacted in 1954, courts had interpreted
provisions containing the phrase “court of competent
jurisdiction” to grant jurisdiction and that Congress was
entitled to rely on those interpretations. This argument
invokes the prior construction canon of statutory interpre-
tation. The canon teaches that if courts have settled the
meaning of an existing provision, the enactment of a new
provision that mirrors the existing statutory text indi-
cates, as a general matter, that the new provision has that
same meaning. See Bragdon v. Abbott, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="118241"><a href="/opinion/118241/bragdon-v-abbott/"><span class="volume">524</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">624</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 645
(1998).
  Fannie Mae points to cases discussing three types of
statutory provisions that, in its view, show that the phrase
“court of competent jurisdiction” had acquired a settled
meaning by 1954.
  The first pair addresses the FHA’s sue-and-be-sued
clause. See </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">12</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §1702 (“sue and be sued in any
court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal”). Two
Court of Appeals decisions in the 1940’s concluded that the
FHA sue-and-be-sued clause overrode the general rule,
today found in </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">28</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §§1346(a)(2), 1491, that mone-

than the federal district courts. See Ferguson v. Union

jurisdiction was founded on the sue-and-be-sued clause, as
opposed to statutes governing the original jurisdiction of
the federal district courts. See, e.g., </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">28</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §41(a)
(1946 ed.). Thus, even assuming that two appellate court
cases can “ ‘settle’ ” an issue, A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Read-
ing Law 325 (2012), these two cases did not because they
did not speak to the question here.
   The second set of cases addresses provisions authorizing
suit for a violation of a statute. One arose under the Fair
Labor Standards Act of 1938, which authorizes employees
to sue for violations of the Act in “any . . . court of compe-
tent jurisdiction.” §6(d)(1), 88 Stat. 61, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">29</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §216(b).
This Court, in its description of the facts, stated that

brief, ambiguous statement did not settle the meaning of
§216(b), and thus did not settle the meaning of the phrase
“court of competent jurisdiction.” The other cases in this
set dealt with the Housing and Rent Act of 1947. As
enacted, the statute permitted suit in “any Federal, State,
or Territorial court of competent jurisdiction.” §206(b), 61
Stat. 199. Some courts read §206 not to confer jurisdiction
and instead assessed their jurisdiction under the federal-
question jurisdiction statute.        See, e.g., Schuman v.
Greenberg, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">100</span> <span class="reporter">F. Supp.</span> <span class="page">187</span></span><pre class="inline">, 189 (NJ 1951) (collecting

controversy requirement, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">28</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §41(1) (1946 ed.), and
so some cases were dismissed or remanded to state court
for lack of federal jurisdiction. Congress later amended
§206 to permit suit “in any Federal court of competent
jurisdiction regardless of the amount involved.” Defense
Production Act Amendments of 1951, §204, 65 Stat. 147.
Congress’ elimination of the amount-in-controversy re-
quirement suggests, if anything, it understood that “court
of competent jurisdiction” could be read to require an

outside source of jurisdiction.
  The third set of cases interpreted provisions making
federal jurisdiction over certain causes of action exclusive.
Brief for Respondents 36–37. Those cases confirm that the
provisions require suit to be brought in federal courts but
do not discuss the basis for federal jurisdiction.
  In sum, none of the cases on which Fannie Mae relies
suggest that Congress in 1954 would have surveyed the
jurisprudential landscape and necessarily concluded that
the courts had already settled the question whether a sue-
and-be-sued clause containing the phrase “court of compe-
tent jurisdiction” confers jurisdiction on the federal courts.
                              C
  Fannie Mae ends with an appeal to congressional pur-
pose, or, more accurately, a lack of congressional purpose.
  It argues that its original sue-and-be-sued clause, en-
acted in 1934, granted jurisdiction to federal courts and
that there is no indication that Congress wanted to change
the status quo in 1954. The addition in 1954 of “court of
competent jurisdiction,” a phrase that, as discussed, car-
ries a clear meaning, means that the current sue-and-be-
sued clause does not confer jurisdiction. An indication
whether that meaning was understood as a change from
the 1934 Act is not required.*
  Fannie Mae next points to its sibling rival, the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac.
The two share parallel authority to compete in the second-

——————
  * The legislative history of the 1934 Act provides some reason to
question Fannie Mae’s premise about Congress’ view of the status quo
under the 1934 Act. During debate on this provision, Senator Logan
asked Senator Bulkley, the chair of the subcommittee with authority
over the bill, about the original sue-and-be-sued clause. Senator
Bulkley explained that it merely conferred a capacity to sue and be
sued “and [did] not confe[r] a right to go into a Federal court where it
would not otherwise exist.” 78 Cong. Rec. 12008 (1934).

involving Freddie Mac may be brought in federal court.
See §1452(c) (“to sue and be sued, complain and defend, in

§§1345, 1442, that civil actions to which Freddie Mac is a
party arise under federal law, and that Freddie Mac may
remove cases to federal district court before trial).
   Fannie Mae argues there is no good reason to think that
Congress gave Freddie Mac fuller access to the federal
courts than it has. Leaving aside the clear textual indica-
tions suggesting Congress did just that, a plausible reason
does exist. In 1970, when Freddie Mac’s sue-and-be-sued
clause and related jurisdictional provisions were enacted,
Freddie Mac was a Government-owned corporation. See
Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970, §304(a), 84 Stat.
454. Fannie Mae, on the other hand, had already transi-
tioned into a privately owned corporation. Fannie Mae’s
argument on this front, moreover, contains a deeper flaw.
The doors to federal court remain open to Fannie Mae
through diversity and federal-question jurisdiction. Fan-
nie Mae provides no reason to think that in other cases,
involving only state-law claims, access to the federal
courts gives Freddie Mac an unintended competitive ad-
vantage over Fannie Mae that Congress would have wanted
to avoid. Indeed, the usual assumption is that state courts
are up to the task of adjudicating their own laws. Cf.
