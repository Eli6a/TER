   No. 12–1184. Argued February 26, 2014—Decided April 29, 2014

     Respondent ICON Health &amp; Fitness, Inc., sued petitioner Octane
  Fitness, LLC, for patent infringement. The District Court granted
  summary judgment to Octane. Octane then moved for attorney’s fees
  under §285. The District Court denied the motion under the Brooks
  Furniture framework, finding ICON’s claim to be neither objectively
  baseless nor brought in subjective bad faith. The Federal Circuit af-
  firmed.
Held: The Brooks Furniture framework is unduly rigid and impermissi-
 bly encumbers the statutory grant of discretion to district courts.
 Pp. 7–12.
    (a) Section 285 imposes one and only one constraint on district
 courts’ discretion to award attorney’s fees: The power is reserved for
 “exceptional” cases. Because the Patent Act does not define “excep-
 tional,” the term is construed “in accordance with [its] ordinary
 meaning.” Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U. S. ___, ___. In 1952, when Con-
 gress used the word in §285 (and today, for that matter),
 “[e]xceptional” meant “uncommon,” “rare,” or “not ordinary.” Web-
 ster’s New International Dictionary 889 (2d ed. 1934). An “excep-
 tional” case, then, is simply one that stands out from others with re-

                                  Syllabus

    spect to the substantive strength of a party’s litigating position (con-
    sidering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the un-
    reasonable manner in which the case was litigated. District courts
    may determine whether a case is “exceptional” in the case-by-case
    exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of the circum-
    stances. Cf. Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112934"><a href="/opinion/112934/fogerty-v-fantasy-inc/">510 U. S. 517</a></span><pre class="inline">. Pp. 7–8.
       (b) The Brooks Furniture framework superimposes an inflexible
    framework onto statutory text that is inherently flexible. Pp. 8–11.
         (1) Brooks Furniture is too restrictive in defining the two catego-
    ries of cases in which fee awards are allowed. The first category—
    cases involving litigation or certain other misconduct—appears to ex-
    tend largely to independently sanctionable conduct. But that is not
    the appropriate benchmark. A district court may award fees in the
    rare case in which a party’s unreasonable, though not independently
    sanctionable, conduct is so “exceptional” as to justify an award. For
    litigation to fall within the second category, a district court must de-
    termine that the litigation is both objectively baseless and brought in
    subjective bad faith. But a case presenting either subjective bad
    faith or exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself
    apart from mine-run cases to be “exceptional.” The Federal Circuit
    imported this second category from Professional Real Estate Inves-
    tors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112855"><a href="/opinion/112855/professional-real-estate-investors-inc-v-columbia-pictures-industries/">508 U. S. 49</a></span><pre class="inline">, but that
    case’s standard finds no roots in §285’s text and makes little sense in
    the context of the exceptional-case determination. Pp. 8–10.
         (2) Brooks Furniture is so demanding that it would appear to
    render §285 largely superfluous. Because courts already possess the
    inherent power to award fees in cases involving misconduct or bad
    faith, see Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="109246"><a href="/opinion/109246/alyeska-pipeline-service-co-v-wilderness-society/">421 U. S.
    240</a></span><pre class="inline">, 258–259, this Court has declined to construe fee-shifting provi-
    sions narrowly so as to avoid rendering them superfluous. See, e.g.,
    Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="109769"><a href="/opinion/109769/christiansburg-garment-co-v-eeoc/">434 U. S. 412</a></span><pre class="inline">, 419. Pp. 10–11.
         (3) Brooks Furniture’s requirement that proof of entitlement to
    fees be made by clear and convincing evidence is not justified by
    §285, which imposes no specific evidentiary burden. Nor has this
    Court interpreted comparable fee-shifting statutes to require such a
    burden of proof. See, e.g., Fogerty, 510 U. S, at 519. P. 11.

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

                                 [April 29, 2014] 


   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.*
   Section 285 of the Patent Act authorizes a district court
to award attorney’s fees in patent litigation. It provides,
in its entirety, that “[t]he court in exceptional cases may
award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.”
</pre><span class="citation no-link">35 U. S. C. §285</span><pre class="inline">. In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Du­
tailier Int’l, Inc., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="788814"><a href="/opinion/788814/brooks-furniture-manufacturing-inc-v-dutailier-international-inc-and/">393 F. 3d 1378</a></span><pre class="inline"> (2005), the United States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that “[a] case
may be deemed exceptional” under §285 only in two lim-
ited circumstances: “when there has been some material
inappropriate conduct,” or when the litigation is both
“brought in subjective bad faith” and “objectively base-
less.” Id., at 1381. The question before us is whether the
Brooks Furniture framework is consistent with the statu-
tory text. We hold that it is not.

patent litigation. Rather, the “American Rule” governed:
“ ‘[E]ach litigant pa[id] his own attorney’s fees, win or
lose . . . .’ ” Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. ___,
___ (2013) (slip op., at 9). In 1946, Congress amended the
Patent Act to add a discretionary fee-shifting provision,
then codified in §70, which stated that a court “may in its
discretion award reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevail-
ing party upon the entry of judgment in any patent case.”
</pre><span class="citation no-link">35 U. S. C. §70</span><pre class="inline"> (1946 ed.).1
    Courts did not award fees under §70 as a matter of
course. They viewed the award of fees not “as a penalty
for failure to win a patent infringement suit,” but as ap-
propriate “only in extraordinary circumstances.” Park-In-
Theatres, Inc. v. Perkins, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="227463"><a href="/opinion/227463/park-in-theatres-inc-v-perkins/">190 F. 2d 137</a></span><pre class="inline">, 142 (CA9 1951).
The provision enabled them to address “unfairness or bad
faith in the conduct of the losing party, or some other
equitable consideration of similar force,” which made a
case so unusual as to warrant fee-shifting. Ibid.; see also
Pennsylvania Crusher Co. v. Bethlehem Steel Co., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="228444"><a href="/opinion/228444/pennsylvania-crusher-co-v-bethlehem-steel-co/">193 F.
2d 445</a></span><pre class="inline">, 451 (CA3 1951) (listing as “adequate justifica-
tion[s]” for fee awards “fraud practiced on the Patent
Office or vexatious or unjustified litigation”).
    Six years later, Congress amended the fee-shifting
provision and recodified it as §285. Whereas §70 had
specified that a district court could “in its discretion award
reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party,” the
revised language of §285 (which remains in force today)
provides that “[t]he court in exceptional cases may award
reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.” We have
observed, in interpreting the damages provision of the
Patent Act, that the addition of the phrase “exceptional

fees [would] become an ordinary thing in patent suits . . . .” S. Rep. No.
79–1503, p. 2 (1946).

cases” to §285 was “for purposes of clarification only.”2
General Motors Corp. v. Devex Corp., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="110940"><a href="/opinion/110940/general-motors-corp-v-devex-corp/">461 U. S. 648</a></span><pre class="inline">, 653,

that the recodification did not substantively alter the
meaning of the statute.3
   For three decades after the enactment of §285, courts
applied it—as they had applied §70—in a discretionary
manner, assessing various factors to determine whether a
given case was sufficiently “exceptional” to warrant a fee
award. See, e.g., True Temper Corp. v. CF&amp;I Steel Corp.,
</pre><span class="citation" data-id="367323"><a href="/opinion/367323/true-temper-corporation-and-cross-appellee-v-cfi-steel-corporation-and/">601 F. 2d 495</a></span><pre class="inline">, 508–509 (CA10 1979); Kearney &amp; Trecker
Corp. v. Giddings &amp; Lewis, Inc., </pre><span class="citation no-link">452 F. 2d 579</span><pre class="inline">, 597 (CA7

1965).
   In 1982, Congress created the Federal Circuit and vested
it with exclusive appellate jurisdiction in patent cases.
</pre><span class="citation no-link">28 U. S. C. §1295</span><pre class="inline">. In the two decades that followed, the
Federal Circuit, like the regional circuits before it, in-
structed district courts to consider the totality of the cir-
cumstances when making fee determinations under §285.
See, e.g., Rohm &amp; Haas Co. v. Crystal Chemical Co., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="437215"><a href="/opinion/437215/rohm-haas-company-v-crystal-chemical-company-and-joe-c-eller/">736
F. 2d 688</a></span><pre class="inline">, 691 (1984) (“Cases decided under §285 have
noted that ‘the substitution of the phrase “in exceptional
cases” has not done away with the discretionary feature’ ”);
——————
  2 The Senate Report similarly explained that the new provision was

“substantially the same as” §70, and that the “ ‘exceptional cases’ ”
language was added simply to “expres[s] the intention of the [1946]
statute as shown by its legislative history and as interpreted by the
courts.” S. Rep. No. 82–1979, p. 30 (1952).
  3 See Brief for Petitioner 35 (“[T]his amendment was not intended to

create a stricter standard for fee awards, but instead was intended to
clarify and endorse the already-existing statutory standard”); Brief for
Respondent 17 (“When it enacted §285, as the historical notes to this
provision make clear, Congress adopted the standards applied by courts
interpreting that statute’s predecessor, §70 of the 1946 statute. Con-
gress explained that §285 ‘is substantially the same as the correspond-
ing provision in’ §70”).

macal, Inc., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="771066"><a href="/opinion/771066/yamanouchi-pharmaceutical-co-ltd-and-merck-co-inc-v-danbury/">231 F. 3d 1339</a></span><pre class="inline">, 1347 (2000) (“In assessing
whether a case qualifies as exceptional, the district court
must look at the totality of the circumstances”).
   In 2005, however, the Federal Circuit abandoned that
holistic, equitable approach in favor of a more rigid and
mechanical formulation. In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v.
Dutailier Int’l, Inc., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="788814"><a href="/opinion/788814/brooks-furniture-manufacturing-inc-v-dutailier-international-inc-and/">393 F. 3d 1378</a></span><pre class="inline"> (2005), the court held
that a case is “exceptional” under §285 only “when there
has been some material inappropriate conduct related to
the matter in litigation, such as willful infringement,
fraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the patent,
misconduct during litigation, vexatious or unjustified
litigation, conduct that violates Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, or like
infractions.” Id., at 1381. “Absent misconduct in conduct
of the litigation or in securing the patent,” the Federal
Circuit continued, fees “may be imposed against the pa-
tentee only if both (1) the litigation is brought in subjec-
tive bad faith, and (2) the litigation is objectively base-
less.” Ibid. The Federal Circuit subsequently clarified
that litigation is objectively baseless only if it is “so unrea-
sonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it would
succeed,” iLOR, LLC v. Google, Inc., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="182586"><a href="/opinion/182586/ilor-llc-v-google-inc/">631 F. 3d 1372</a></span><pre class="inline">, 1378

Fed 2013)—decided after our grant of certiorari but before we heard
oral argument in this case—the Federal Circuit appeared to cut back on
the “subjective bad faith” inquiry, holding that the language in iLOR
was dictum and that “actual knowledge of baselessness is not required.”
738 F. 3d, at 1310. Rather, the court held, “a defendant need only
prove reckless conduct to satisfy the subjective component of the §285
analysis,” ibid., and courts may “dra[w] an inference of bad faith from
circumstantial evidence thereof when a patentee pursues claims that
are devoid of merit,” id., at 1311. Most importantly, the Federal Circuit
stated that “[o]bjective baselessness alone can create a sufficient

                          Opinion of the Court

  Finally, Brooks Furniture held that because “[t]here is a
presumption that the assertion of infringement of a duly
granted patent is made in good faith[,] . . . the underlying
improper conduct and the characterization of the case as
exceptional must be established by clear and convincing
evidence.” </pre><span class="citation" data-id="788814"><a href="/opinion/788814/brooks-furniture-manufacturing-inc-v-dutailier-international-inc-and/">393 F. 3d, at 1382</a></span><pre class="inline">.

   The parties to this litigation are manufacturers of exer-
cise equipment. The respondent, ICON Health &amp; Fitness,
Inc., owns U. S. Patent No. 6,019,710 (’710 patent), which
discloses an elliptical exercise machine that allows for
adjustments to fit the individual stride paths of users.
ICON is a major manufacturer of exercise equipment, but
it has never commercially sold the machine disclosed in
the ’710 patent. The petitioner, Octane Fitness, LLC, also
manufactures exercise equipment, including elliptical
machines known as the Q45 and Q47.
   ICON sued Octane, alleging that the Q45 and Q47
infringed several claims of the ’710 patent. The District
Court granted Octane’s motion for summary judgment,
concluding that Octane’s machines did not infringe ICON’s
patent. </pre><span class="citation no-link">2011 WL 2457914</span><pre class="inline"> (D Minn., June 17, 2011).
Octane then moved for attorney’s fees under §285. Apply-

denied Octane’s motion. </pre><span class="citation no-link">2011 WL 3900975</span><pre class="inline"> (D Minn.,

inference of bad faith to establish exceptionality under §285, unless the 

circumstances as a whole show a lack of recklessness on the patentee’s 

part.” Id., at 1314. Chief Judge Rader wrote a concurring opinion that

argument that the judgment of noninfringement “should
have been a foregone conclusion to anyone who visually
inspected” Octane’s machines. Id., *2. The court ex-
plained that although it had rejected ICON’s infringement
arguments, they were neither “frivolous” nor “objectively
baseless.” Id., *2–*3. The court also found no subjective
bad faith on ICON’s part, dismissing as insufficient both
“the fact that [ICON] is a bigger company which never
commercialized the ’710 patent” and an e-mail exchange
between two ICON sales executives, which Octane had
offered as evidence that ICON had brought the infringe-
ment action “as a matter of commercial strategy.”5 Id., *4.
   ICON appealed the judgment of noninfringement, and
Octane cross-appealed the denial of attorney’s fees. The
Federal Circuit affirmed both orders. </pre><span class="citation no-link">496 Fed. Appx. 57</span><pre class="inline">

“applied an overly restrictive standard in refusing to find
the case exceptional under §285.” Id., at 65. The Federal
Circuit declined to “revisit the settled standard for excep-
tionality.” Ibid.

                      Opinion of the Court

                          II
  The framework established by the Federal Circuit in
Brooks Furniture is unduly rigid, and it impermissibly
encumbers the statutory grant of discretion to district
courts.
                              A
   Our analysis begins and ends with the text of §285: “The
court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney
fees to the prevailing party.” This text is patently clear.
It imposes one and only one constraint on district courts’
discretion to award attorney’s fees in patent litigation: The
power is reserved for “exceptional” cases.
   The Patent Act does not define “exceptional,” so we
construe it “ ‘in accordance with [its] ordinary meaning.’ ”

see also Bilski v. Kappos, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="149649"><a href="/opinion/149649/bilski-v-kappos/">561 U. S. 593</a></span><pre class="inline">, ___ (2010) (slip
op., at 6) (“In patent law, as in all statutory construction,
‘[u]nless otherwise defined, “words will be interpreted as
taking their ordinary, contemporary, common mean-
ing” ’ ”). In 1952, when Congress used the word in §285
(and today, for that matter), “[e]xceptional” meant “un-
common,” “rare,” or “not ordinary.” Webster’s New Inter-
national Dictionary 889 (2d ed. 1934); see also 3 Oxford
English Dictionary 374 (1933) (defining “exceptional” as
“out of the ordinary course,” “unusual,” or “special”);

2008) (defining “exceptional” as “rare”); Noxell Corp. v.

(interpreting the term “exceptional” in the Lanham Act’s
identical fee-shifting provision, </pre><span class="citation no-link">15 U. S. C. §1117</span><pre class="inline">(a), to
mean “uncommon” or “not run-of-the-mill”).
   We hold, then, that an “exceptional” case is simply one
that stands out from others with respect to the substan-
tive strength of a party’s litigating position (considering

both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the
unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.
District courts may determine whether a case is “excep-
tional” in the case-by-case exercise of their discretion,
considering the totality of the circumstances.6 As in the
comparable context of the Copyright Act, “ ‘[t]here is no
precise rule or formula for making these determinations,’
but instead equitable discretion should be exercised ‘in
light of the considerations we have identified.’ ” Fogerty v.
Fantasy, Inc., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112934"><a href="/opinion/112934/fogerty-v-fantasy-inc/">510 U. S. 517</a></span><pre class="inline">, 534 (1994).

                                1
   The Federal Circuit’s formulation is overly rigid. Under
the standard crafted in Brooks Furniture, a case is “excep-
tional” only if a district court either finds litigation-related
misconduct of an independently sanctionable magnitude
or determines that the litigation was both “brought in
subjective bad faith” and “objectively baseless.” </pre><span class="citation" data-id="788814"><a href="/opinion/788814/brooks-furniture-manufacturing-inc-v-dutailier-international-inc-and/">393 F. 3d,
at 1381</a></span><pre class="inline">. This formulation superimposes an inflexible
framework onto statutory text that is inherently flexible.
   For one thing, the first category of cases in which the
Federal Circuit allows fee awards—those involving litiga-
tion misconduct or certain other misconduct—appears to
extend largely to independently sanctionable conduct. See

explained that in determining whether to award fees under a similar
provision in the Copyright Act, district courts could consider a “nonex-

and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of
compensation and deterrence.” </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112934"><a href="/opinion/112934/fogerty-v-fantasy-inc/">Id., at 534, n. 19</a></span><pre class="inline"> (internal quotation

tious or unjustified litigation, conduct that violates Fed. R.
Civ. P. 11, or like infractions”). But sanctionable conduct
is not the appropriate benchmark. Under the standard
announced today, a district court may award fees in the
rare case in which a party’s unreasonable conduct—while
not necessarily independently sanctionable—is nonethe-
less so “exceptional” as to justify an award of fees.
   The second category of cases in which the Federal Cir-
cuit allows fee awards is also too restrictive. In order for a
case to fall within this second category, a district court
must determine both that the litigation is objectively
baseless and that the plaintiff brought it in subjective bad
faith. But a case presenting either subjective bad faith or
exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself
apart from mine-run cases to warrant a fee award. Cf.
Noxell, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="457684"><a href="/opinion/457684/noxell-corporation-v-firehouse-no-1-bar-b-que-restaurant-dba-san/">771 F. 2d, at 526</a></span><pre class="inline"> (“[W]e think it fair to assume
that Congress did not intend rigidly to limit recovery of
fees by a [Lanham Act] defendant to the rare case in
which a court finds that the plaintiff ‘acted in bad faith,
vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons’ . . . .
Something less than ‘bad faith,’ we believe, suffices to
mark a case as ‘exceptional’ ”).
   ICON argues that the dual requirement of “subjective
bad faith” and “objective baselessness” follows from this
Court’s decision in Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc.
v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112855"><a href="/opinion/112855/professional-real-estate-investors-inc-v-columbia-pictures-industries/">508 U. S. 49</a></span><pre class="inline"> (1993)

tion” to this doctrine, “activity ‘ostensibly directed toward
10 OCTANE FITNESS, LLC v. ICON HEALTH &amp; FITNESS, INC.

                      Opinion of the Court

influencing governmental action’ does not qualify for
Noerr immunity if it ‘is a mere sham to cover . . . an at-
tempt to interfere directly with the business relationships
of a competitor.’ ” </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112855"><a href="/opinion/112855/professional-real-estate-investors-inc-v-columbia-pictures-industries/">Id., at 51</a></span><pre class="inline">. In PRE, we held that to
qualify as a “sham,” a “lawsuit must be objectively base-
less” and must “concea[l] ‘an attempt to interfere directly
with the business relationships of a competitor . . . .’ ” </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112855"><a href="/opinion/112855/professional-real-estate-investors-inc-v-columbia-pictures-industries/">Id.,</a></span><pre class="inline">
at 60–61 (emphasis deleted). In other words, the plaintiff
must have brought baseless claims in an attempt to
thwart competition (i.e., in bad faith).
   In Brooks Furniture, the Federal Circuit imported the
PRE standard into §285. See </pre><span class="citation" data-id="788814"><a href="/opinion/788814/brooks-furniture-manufacturing-inc-v-dutailier-international-inc-and/">393 F. 3d, at 1381</a></span><pre class="inline">. But the
PRE standard finds no roots in the text of §285, and it
makes little sense in the context of determining whether a
case is so “exceptional” as to justify an award of attorney’s
fees in patent litigation. We crafted the Noerr-Pennington
doctrine—and carved out only a narrow exception for
“sham” litigation—to avoid chilling the exercise of the
First Amendment right to petition the government for the
redress of grievances. See PRE, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112855"><a href="/opinion/112855/professional-real-estate-investors-inc-v-columbia-pictures-industries/">508 U. S., at 56</a></span><pre class="inline"> (“Those
who petition government for redress are generally im-
mune from antitrust liability”). But to the extent that
patent suits are similarly protected as acts of petitioning,
it is not clear why the shifting of fees in an “exceptional”
case would diminish that right. The threat of antitrust
liability (and the attendant treble damages, </pre><span class="citation no-link">15 U. S. C.
§15</span><pre class="inline">) far more significantly chills the exercise of the right
to petition than does the mere shifting of attorney’s fees.
In the Noerr-Pennington context, defendants seek immun-
ity from a judicial declaration that their filing of a lawsuit
was actually unlawful; here, they seek immunity from a
far less onerous declaration that they should bear the
costs of that lawsuit in exceptional cases.

demanding that it would appear to render §285 largely
superfluous. We have long recognized a common-law
exception to the general “American rule” against fee-
shifting—an exception, “inherent” in the “power [of] the
courts” that applies for “ ‘willful disobedience of a court
order’ ” or “when the losing party has ‘acted in bad faith,
vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons . . . .’ ”

fee-shifting statutes to require proof of entitlement to fees
by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., Fogerty, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112934"><a href="/opinion/112934/fogerty-v-fantasy-inc/">510

(1988). And nothing in §285 justifies such a high standard
of proof. Section 285 demands a simple discretionary
inquiry; it imposes no specific evidentiary burden, much
less such a high one. Indeed, patent-infringement litiga-
tion has always been governed by a preponderance of the
evidence standard, see, e.g., Béné v. Jeantet, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="92442"><a href="/opinion/92442/bene-v-jeantet/">129 U. S. 683</a></span><pre class="inline">,
