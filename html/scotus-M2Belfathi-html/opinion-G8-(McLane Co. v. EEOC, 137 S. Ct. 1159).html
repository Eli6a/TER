        MCLANE CO., INC. v. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT 

             OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION


CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT

    No. 15–1248. Argued February 21, 2017—Decided April 3, 2017
Damiana Ochoa worked for eight years in a physically demanding job
 for petitioner McLane Co., a supply-chain services company. McLane
 requires employees in those positions—both new employees and
 those returning from medical leave—to take a physical evaluation.
 When Ochoa returned from three months of maternity leave, she
 failed the evaluation three times and was fired. She then filed a sex
 discrimination charge under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
 The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEOC) began an investigation,
 but McLane declined its request for so-called “pedigree information”:
 names, Social Security numbers, addresses, and telephone numbers
 of employees asked to take the evaluation. After the EEOC expanded
 the investigation’s scope both geographically (to cover McLane’s na-
 tional operations) and substantively (to investigate possible age dis-
 crimination), it issued subpoenas, as authorized by </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">42</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">.
 §2000e–9, requesting pedigree information relating to its new inves-
 tigation. When McLane refused to provide the information, the
 EEOC filed two actions in Federal District Court—one arising out of
 Ochoa’s charge and one arising out of the EEOC’s own age-
 discrimination charge—seeking enforcement of its subpoenas. The
 District Judge declined to enforce the subpoenas, finding that the
 pedigree information was not relevant to the charges, but the Ninth
 Circuit reversed. Reviewing the District Court’s decision to quash
 the subpoena de novo, the court concluded that the lower court erred
 in finding the pedigree information irrelevant.
Held: A district court’s decision whether to enforce or quash an EEOC
 subpoena should be reviewed for abuse of discretion, not de novo.

2                           MCLANE CO. v. EEOC

                                    Syllabus

        (a) Both factors that this Court examines when considering wheth-
    er such decision should be subject to searching or deferential appel-
    late review point toward abuse-of-discretion review. First, the
    longstanding practice of the courts of appeals is to review a district
    court’s decision to enforce or quash an administrative subpoena for
    abuse of discretion. Title VII confers on the EEOC the same authori-
    ty to issue subpoenas that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)
    confers on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). During the
    three decades between the NLRA’s enactment and the incorporation
    of its subpoena-enforcement provisions into Title VII, every Circuit to
    consider the question had held that a district court’s decision on en-
    forcement of an NLRB subpoena is subject to abuse-of-discretion re-
    view. Congress amended Title VII to authorize EEOC subpoenas
    against this uniform backdrop of deferential appellate review, and
    today, nearly every Court of Appeals reviews a district court’s deci-
    sion whether to enforce an EEOC subpoena for abuse of discretion.
    This “long history of appellate practice,” Pierce v. Underwood, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112137"><a href="/opinion/112137/pierce-v-underwood/"><span class="volume">487</span>
<span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">552</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 558, carries significant persuasive weight.
        Second, basic principles of institutional capacity counsel in favor of
    deferential review. In most cases, the district court’s enforcement de-
    cision will turn either on whether the evidence sought is relevant to
    the specific charge or whether the subpoena is unduly burdensome in
    light of the circumstances. Both of these tasks are well suited to a
    district judge’s expertise. The first requires the district court to eval-
    uate the relationship between the particular materials sought and
    the particular matter under investigation—an analysis “variable in
    relation to the nature, purposes and scope of the inquiry.” Oklahoma
    Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="104239"><a href="/opinion/104239/oklahoma-press-publishing-co-v-walling/"><span class="volume">327</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">186</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 209. And whether a
    subpoena is overly burdensome turns on the nature of the materials
    sought and the difficulty the employer will face in producing them—
    “ ‘fact-intensive, close calls’ ” better suited to resolution by the district
    court than the court of appeals. Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp.,
    </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112457"><a href="/opinion/112457/cooter-gell-v-hartmarx-corp/"><span class="volume">496</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">384</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 404.
        Other functional considerations also show the appropriateness of
    abuse-of-discretion review. For one, the district courts’ considerable
    experience in making similar decisions in other contexts, see Buford
    v. United States, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="118413"><a href="/opinion/118413/buford-v-united-states/"><span class="volume">532</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">59</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 66, gives them the “institutional ad-
    vantag[e],” </pre><span class="citation" data-id="118413"><a href="/opinion/118413/buford-v-united-states/"><span class="id_token">id.,</span> at 64, </a></span><pre class="inline">that comes with greater experience. Deferen-
    tial review also “streamline[s] the litigation process by freeing appel-
    late courts from the duty of reweighing evidence and reconsidering
    facts already weighed and considered by the district court,” Cooter &amp;
    </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112457"><span class="antecedent_guess">Gell,</span> <a href="/opinion/112457/cooter-gell-v-hartmarx-corp/"><span class="volume">496</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>, at <span class="page">404</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, something particularly important in a pro-
    ceeding designed only to facilitate the EEOC’s investigation. Pp. 6–9.
        (b) Court-appointed amicus’ arguments in support of de novo re-
                     Cite as: 581 U. S. ____ (2017)                     3

  view are not persuasive. Amicus claims that the district court’s pri-
  mary task is to test a subpoena’s legal sufficiency and thus requires
  no exercise of discretion. But that characterization is not inconsistent
  with abuse-of-discretion review, which may be employed to insulate
  the trial judge’s decision from appellate review for the same kind of
  functional concerns that underpin the Court’s conclusion that abuse
  of discretion is the appropriate standard.
     It is also unlikely that affording deferential review to a district
  court’s subpoena decision would clash with Court of Appeals deci-
  sions that instructed district courts to defer to the EEOC’s determi-
  nation about the relevance of evidence to the charge at issue. Such
  decisions are better read as resting on the established rule that the
  term “relevant” be understood “generously” to permit the EEOC “ac-
  cess to virtually any material that might cast light on the allegations
  against the employer.” EEOC v. Shell Oil Co., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="111141"><a href="/opinion/111141/eeoc-v-shell-oil-co/"><span class="volume">466</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">54</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 68–69.
  Nor do the constitutional underpinnings of the Shell Oil standard re-
  quire a different result. While this Court has described a subpoena
  as a “ ‘constructive’ search,” Oklahoma </pre><span class="citation" data-id="104239"><span class="antecedent_guess">Press,</span> <a href="/opinion/104239/oklahoma-press-publishing-co-v-walling/"><span class="volume">327</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>, at <span class="page">202</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, and

  MCLANE COMPANY, INC., PETITIONER v. EQUAL 

   EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                                [April 3, 2017]


   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 permits the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to
issue a subpoena to obtain evidence from an employer that
is relevant to a pending investigation. The statute autho-
rizes a district court to issue an order enforcing such a
subpoena. The question presented here is whether a court
of appeals should review a district court’s decision to
enforce or quash an EEOC subpoena de novo or for abuse
of discretion. This decision should be reviewed for abuse
of discretion.

ployment discrimination on the basis of “race, color, reli-
gion, sex, or national origin.” §703(a), 78 Stat. 255, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">42</span>

   This case is about one of the tools the EEOC has at its
disposal in conducting its investigation: a subpoena. In
order “[t]o enable the [EEOC] to make informed decisions
at each stage of the enforcement process,” Title VII “con-
fers a broad right of access to relevant evidence.” </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112346"><a href="/opinion/112346/universityof-pennsylvania-v-eeoc/"><span class="id_token">Id.,</span> at

for the purposes of examination, . . . any evidence of any

VII and “is relevant to the charge under investigation.” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">42</span>
<span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §2000e–8(a). And the statute enables the EEOC
to obtain that evidence by “authoriz[ing] [it] to issue a

that authority, the EEOC may issue “subp[o]enas requir-

it, see §161(2).

   This case arises out of a Title VII suit filed by a woman
named Damiana Ochoa. Ochoa worked for eight years as
a “cigarette selector” for petitioner McLane Co., a supply-
chain services company. According to McLane, the job is a
demanding one: Cigarette selectors work in distribution
centers, where they are required to lift, pack, and move
large bins containing products. McLane requires employ-
ees taking physically demanding jobs—both new employ-
ees and employees returning from medical leave—to take

4                   MCLANE CO. v. EEOC

                     Opinion of the Court

to work, McLane asked her to take the evaluation. Ochoa
attempted to pass the evaluation three times, but failed.
McLane fired her.
   Ochoa filed a charge of discrimination, alleging (among
other things) that she had been fired on the basis of her
gender. The EEOC began an investigation, and—at its
request—McLane provided it with basic information about
the evaluation, as well as a list of anonymous employees
that McLane had asked to take the evaluation. McLane’s
list included each employee’s gender, role at the company,
and evaluation score, as well as the reason each employee
had been asked to take the evaluation. But the company
refused to provide what the parties call “pedigree infor-
mation”: the names, Social Security numbers, last known
addresses, and telephone numbers of the employees who
had been asked to take the evaluation. Upon learning
that McLane used the evaluation nationwide, the EEOC
expanded the scope of its investigation, both geographi-
cally (to focus on McLane’s nationwide operations) and sub-
stantively (to investigate whether McLane had discrimi-
nated against its employees on the basis of age). It issued
subpoenas requesting pedigree information as it related to
its new investigation. But McLane refused to provide
the pedigree information, and so the EEOC filed two
actions in Federal District Court—one arising out of
Ochoa’s charge and one arising out of a separate age-
discrimination charge the EEOC itself had filed—seeking
enforcement of its subpoenas.
   The enforcement actions were assigned to the same
District Judge, who, after a hearing, declined to enforce
the subpoenas to the extent that they sought the pedigree
information. See EEOC v. McLane Co., </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">2012</span> <span class="reporter">WL</span> <span class="page">1132758</span></span><pre class="inline">,

pedigree information was not “relevant” to the charges

that it sought a second category of evidence: information about when

   When considering whether a district court’s decision
should be subject to searching or deferential appellate
review—at least absent “explicit statutory command”—we
traditionally look to two factors. Pierce v. Underwood, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112137"><a href="/opinion/112137/pierce-v-underwood/"><span class="volume">487</span>

least </span><pre class="inline">where “neither a clear statutory prescription nor a
historical tradition exists,” we ask whether, “ ‘as a matter
of the sound administration of justice, one judicial actor is
better positioned than another to decide the issue in ques-
tion.’ ” </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112137"><a href="/opinion/112137/pierce-v-underwood/"><span class="id_token">Id.,</span> at 558, </a></span><pre class="inline">559–560 (quoting Miller v.

discretion review here.
   First, the longstanding practice of the courts of appeals
in reviewing a district court’s decision to enforce or quash
an administrative subpoena is to review that decision for
abuse of discretion. That practice predates even Title VII
itself. As noted, Title VII confers on the EEOC the same
authority to issue subpoenas that the National Labor
Relations Act (NLRA) confers on the National Labor Rela-
tions Board (NLRB). See n. </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="antecedent_guess">1,</span> supra</span><pre class="inline">. During the three
decades between the enactment of the NLRA and the
incorporation of the NLRA’s subpoena-enforcement provi-
sions into Title VII, every Circuit to consider the question
had held that a district court’s decision whether to enforce
an NLRB subpoena should be reviewed for abuse of discre-
tion. See NLRB v. Consolidated Vacuum Corp., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="280317"><a href="/opinion/280317/national-labor-relations-board-on-the-relation-of-international-union-of/"><span class="volume">395</span> <span class="reporter">F.2d</span>

                     Opinion of the Court

  Today, nearly as uniformly, the Courts of Appeals apply
the same deferential review to a district court’s decision as
to whether to enforce an EEOC subpoena. Almost every
Court of Appeals reviews such a decision for abuse of
discretion. See, e.g., EEOC v. Kronos Inc., </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">620</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">287</span></span><pre class="inline">,

carries significant persuasive weight.
  Second, basic principles of institutional capacity counsel
in favor of deferential review. The decision whether to
enforce an EEOC subpoena is a case-specific one that
turns not on “a neat set of legal rules,” Illinois v. Gates,
</pre><span class="citation" data-id="110959"><a href="/opinion/110959/illinois-v-gates/"><span class="volume">462</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">213</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 232 (1983), but instead on the application of
broad standards to “multifarious, fleeting, special, narrow
facts that utterly resist generalization,” </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112137"><span class="antecedent_guess">Pierce,</span> <a href="/opinion/112137/pierce-v-underwood/"><span class="volume">487</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>,
at <span class="page">561</span></a></span><pre class="inline">–562 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the
mine run of cases, the district court’s decision whether to
enforce a subpoena will turn either on whether the evi-
dence sought is relevant to the specific charge before it or
whether the subpoena is unduly burdensome in light of
the circumstances. Both tasks are well suited to a district
8                        MCLANE CO. v. EEOC

                          Opinion of the Court

judge’s expertise. The decision whether evidence sought is
relevant requires the district court to evaluate the rela-
tionship between the particular materials sought and the
particular matter under investigation—an analysis “vari-
able in relation to the nature, purposes and scope of the
inquiry.” Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="104239"><a href="/opinion/104239/oklahoma-press-publishing-co-v-walling/"><span class="volume">327</span>
<span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">186</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 209 (1946). Similarly, the decision whether a
subpoena is overly burdensome turns on the nature of the
materials sought and the difficulty the employer will face
in producing them. These inquiries are “generally not
amenable to broad per se rules,” Sprint/United Manage-
ment Co. v. Mendelsohn, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="145828"><a href="/opinion/145828/sprintunited-management-co-v-mendelsohn/"><span class="volume">552</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">379</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 387 (2008); rather,

   Other functional considerations also show that abuse-of-
discretion review is appropriate here. For one, district
courts have considerable experience in other contexts
making decisions similar—though not identical—to those
they must make in this one. See Buford v. United States,

  Amicus’ arguments to the contrary have aided our con-
sideration of this case. But they do not persuade us that
de novo review is appropriate.
  Amicus’ central argument is that the decision whether a
subpoena should be enforced does not require the exercise
of discretion on the part of the district court, and so it
should not be reviewed for abuse of discretion. On amicus’
view, the district court’s primary role is to test the legal
sufficiency of the subpoena, not to weigh whether it should
be enforced as a substantive matter. Cf. Shell </pre><span class="citation" data-id="111141"><span class="antecedent_guess">Oil,</span> <a href="/opinion/111141/eeoc-v-shell-oil-co/"><span class="volume">466</span>

court should assess the validity of the underlying claim in
a proceeding to enforce a subpoena). Even accepting
amicus’ view of the district court’s task, however, this
understanding of abuse-of-discretion review is too narrow.
As commentators have observed, abuse-of-discretion re-
view is employed not only where a decisionmaker has “a
wide range of choice as to what he decides, free from the
constraints which characteristically attach whenever legal
rules enter the decision[making] process”; it is also em-
ployed where the trial judge’s decision is given “an unu-

tional reasons. Rosenberg, Judicial Discretion of the Trial

(1971); see also 22 C. Wright &amp; K. Graham, Federal Prac-
tice and Procedure §5166.1 (2d ed. 2012). And as we have
explained, it is in large part due to functional concerns
that we conclude the district court’s decision should be
reviewed for abuse of discretion. Even if the district
court’s decision can be characterized in the way that ami-
cus suggests, that characterization would not be incon-
sistent with abuse-of-discretion review.
   Nor are we persuaded by amicus’ remaining arguments.
Amicus argues that affording deferential review to a dis-
trict court’s decision would clash with Court of Appeals
decisions instructing district courts to defer themselves to
the EEOC’s determination that evidence is relevant to the
charge at issue. See Director, Office of Thrift Supervision,

any scheme of double deference, amicus’ arguments as to
the infirmities of such a scheme are misplaced.

review the District Court’s decision under the appropriate

also consider, as and to the extent it deems appropriate,

imposed by the subpoena.

  MCLANE COMPANY, INC., PETITIONER v. EQUAL 

   EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION

 ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 

            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

                         [April 3, 2017]


   JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.
   While I agree with the Court that “abuse of discretion”
is generally the proper review standard for district court
decisions reviewing agency subpoenas, I would neverthe-
less affirm the Ninth Circuit’s judgment in this case. As
the Court of Appeals explained, the District Court’s re-
fusal to enforce the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission’s (EEOC) subpoena for pedigree information
rested on a legal error. Lower court resolution of a ques-
tion of law is ordinarily reviewable de novo on appeal.
Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Management System,
Inc., 572 U. S. ___, ___, and n. 2 (2014) (slip op., at 4, and
n. 2). According to the District Court, it was not yet “nec-
essary [for the EEOC] to seek such information.” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">2012</span> <span class="reporter">WL</span>
<span class="page">5868959</span></span><pre class="inline">, *6 (D Ariz., Nov. 19, 2012). As the Ninth Circuit
correctly conveyed, however: “The EEOC does not have to
show a ‘particularized necessity of access, beyond a show-
ing of mere relevance,’ to obtain evidence.” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">804</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span>

<span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">182</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 188 (1990)). Because the District Court erred as
a matter of law in demanding that the EEOC show more
than relevance in order to gain enforcement of its sub-
poena, I would not disturb the Court of Appeals’ judgment.
