CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

No. 10–1195. Argued November 28, 2011—Decided January 18, 2012
Consumer complaints about abuses of telephone technology—for exam-
  ple, computerized calls to private homes—prompted Congress to pass

  A. §227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011), and provides that jurisdiction over these
  state-initiated suits lies exclusively in the U. S. district courts,
  §227(g)(2). It also permits a private person to seek redress for viola-
  tions of the Act or regulations “in an appropriate court of [a] State,”

     Petitioner Mims filed a damages action in Federal District Court,
  alleging that respondent Arrow, seeking to collect a debt, violated the
  TCPA by repeatedly using an automatic telephone dialing system or
  prerecorded or artificial voice to call Mims’s cellular phone without
  his consent. Mims invoked the court’s “federal question” jurisdiction,
  i.e., its authority to adjudicate claims “arising under the . . . laws . . .
  of the United States,” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">28</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §1331. The District Court, affirmed
  by the Eleventh Circuit, dismissed Mims’s complaint for want of sub-
  ject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the TCPA had vested juris-
  diction over private actions exclusively in state courts.
Held: The TCPA’s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts does
 not deprive the U. S. district courts of federal-question jurisdiction

    over private TCPA suits. Pp. 7–18.
       (a) Because federal law creates the right of action and provides the
    rules of decision, Mims’s TCPA claim, in §1331’s words, plainly
    “aris[es] under” the “laws . . . of the United States.” Arrow agrees
    that this action arises under federal law, but urges that Congress
    vested exclusive adjudicatory authority over private TCPA actions in
    state courts. In cases “arising under” federal law, there is a pre-
    sumption of concurrent state-court jurisdiction, rebuttable if “Con-
    gress affirmatively ousts the state courts of jurisdiction over a partic-
    ular federal claim.” Tafflin v. Levitt, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="112357"><a href="/opinion/112357/tafflin-v-levitt/"><span class="volume">493</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">455</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 458–459. Arrow
    acknowledges the presumption, but maintains that §1331 creates no
    converse presumption in favor of federal-court jurisdiction. Instead,
    Arrow urges, the TCPA, a later, more specific statute, displaces
    §1331, an earlier, more general prescription.
       Section 1331 is not swept away so easily. The principle that dis-
    trict courts possess federal-question jurisdiction under §1331 when
    federal law creates a private right of action and furnishes the sub-
    stantive rules of decision endures unless Congress divests federal
    courts of their §1331 adjudicatory authority. See, e.g., Verizon Md.
    Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of Md., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="118506"><a href="/opinion/118506/verizon-maryland-inc-v-public-service-commission-of-maryland/"><span class="volume">535</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">635</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 642. Accordingly,
    the District Court retains §1331 jurisdiction over Mims’s complaint
    unless the TCPA, expressly or by fair implication, excludes federal-
    court adjudication. See </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="id_token">id.,</span> at 644. </span><pre class="inline">Pp. 7–10.
       (b) Arrow’s arguments do not persuade this Court that Congress
    eliminated §1331 jurisdiction over private TCPA actions. Title </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">47</span>
<span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §227(b)(3)’s language may be state-court oriented, but “the
    grant of jurisdiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the ju-
    risdiction is to be exclusive,” United States v. Bank of New York &amp;
    Trust Co., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="102533"><a href="/opinion/102533/united-states-v-bank-of-new-york-co/"><span class="volume">296</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">463</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 479. Nothing in §227(b)(3)’s permissive lan-
    guage makes state-court jurisdiction exclusive, or otherwise purports
    to oust federal courts of their §1331 jurisdiction. The provision does
    not state that a private plaintiff may bring a TCPA action “only” or
    “exclusively” in state court. In contrast, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">47</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. A. §227(g)(2)
    (Supp. 2011) vests “exclusive jurisdiction” over state-initiated TCPA
    suits in the federal courts. Section 227(g)(2)’s exclusivity prescription
    “reinforce[s] the conclusion that [</pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">47</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §227(b)(3)’s] silence . . .
    leaves the jurisdictional grant of §1331 untouched. For where other-
    wise applicable jurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was exclud-
    ed expressly.” Verizon </pre><span class="citation" data-id="118506"><span class="antecedent_guess">Md.,</span> <a href="/opinion/118506/verizon-maryland-inc-v-public-service-commission-of-maryland/"><span class="volume">535</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>, at <span class="page">644</span></a></span><pre class="inline">.
       Arrow argues that Congress had no reason to provide for a private
    action “in an appropriate [state] court,” §227(b)(3), if it did not mean
    to make the state forum exclusive, for state courts would have con-
    current jurisdiction even if Congress had said nothing at all. But, as
    already noted, Congress had simultaneously made federal-court ju-

  authorities, see </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">47</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. A. §227(g)(2) (Supp. 2011), and may simp-
  ly have wanted to avoid any argument that federal jurisdiction was
  also exclusive for private actions. Moreover, by providing that pri-
  vate actions may be brought in state court “if otherwise permitted by
  the laws or rules of court of [the] State,” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">47</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §227(b)(3), Con-
  gress arguably gave States leeway they would otherwise lack to de-
  cide whether to entertain TCPA claims.
     Arrow further asserts that making state-court jurisdiction over
  §227(b)(3) claims exclusive serves Congress’ objective of enabling
  States to control telemarketers whose interstate operations evaded
  state law. Even so, jurisdiction conferred by </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">28</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §1331 should

  fill a gap in the States’ enforcement capabilities, it could have provid-
  ed that out-of-state telemarketing calls directed into a State would be
  subject to the receiving State’s laws. Instead, Congress enacted de-
  tailed, uniform, federal substantive prescriptions and provided for a
  regulatory regime administered by a federal agency.
     Arrow’s reliance on a statement by Senator Hollings, the TCPA’s
  sponsor, is misplaced. The remarks nowhere mention federal-court
  jurisdiction or otherwise suggest that </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">47</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §227(b)(3) is intend-
  ed to divest federal courts of authority over TCPA claims. Even if
  Hollings and other TCPA supporters expected private actions to pro-
  ceed solely in state courts, their expectation would not control this
  Court’s judgment on §1331’s compass. Arrow’s arguments that fed-
  eral courts will be inundated by $500-per-violation TCPA claims or
  that defendants could use federal-court removal to force small-claims-
  court plaintiffs to abandon suit seem more imaginary than real.

          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT

                               [January 18, 2012]


  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.
  This case concerns enforcement, through private suits,
of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA
or Act), </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">47</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §227. Voluminous consumer com-
plaints about abuses of telephone technology—for exam-
ple, computerized calls dispatched to private homes—
prompted Congress to pass the TCPA. Congress de-
termined that federal legislation was needed because
telemarketers, by operating interstate, were escaping
state-law prohibitions on intrusive nuisance calls. The Act
bans certain practices invasive of privacy and directs the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission)
to prescribe implementing regulations. It authorizes
States to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited practices
and to recover damages on their residents’ behalf. The
Commission must be notified of such suits and may inter-
vene in them. Jurisdiction over state-initiated TCPA
suits, Congress provided, lies exclusively in the U. S.
district courts. Congress also provided for civil actions by
private parties seeking redress for violations of the TCPA
or of the Commission’s implementing regulations.
2         MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC

                      Opinion of the Court

   Petitioner Marcus D. Mims, complaining of multiple
violations of the Act by respondent Arrow Financial Ser-
vices, LLC (Arrow), a debt-collection agency, commenced
an action for damages against Arrow in the U. S. District
Court for the Southern District of Florida. Mims invoked
the court’s “federal question” jurisdiction, i.e., its authority
to adjudicate claims “arising under the . . . laws . . . of
the United States,” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">28</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §1331. The District Court,
affirmed by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit, dismissed Mims’s complaint for want of subject-
matter jurisdiction. Both courts relied on Congress’ speci-
fication, in the TCPA, that a private person may seek
redress for violations of the Act (or of the Commission’s
regulations thereunder) “in an appropriate court of [a]
State,” “if [such an action is] otherwise permitted by the
laws or rules of court of [that] State.” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">47</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">.
§§227(b)(3), (c)(5).
   The question presented is whether Congress’ provision
for private actions to enforce the TCPA renders state
courts the exclusive arbiters of such actions. We have long
recognized that “[a] suit arises under the law that creates
the cause of action.” American Well Works Co. v. Layne &amp;
Bowler Co., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="98740"><a href="/opinion/98740/american-well-works-company-plff-in-err-v-layne-bowler-company-and/"><span class="volume">241</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">257</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 260 (1916). Beyond doubt, the
TCPA is a federal law that both creates the claim Mims
has brought and supplies the substantive rules that will
govern the case. We find no convincing reason to read into
the TCPA’s permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts
any barrier to the U. S. district courts’ exercise of the
general federal-question jurisdiction they have possessed
since 1875. See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, §1, 18 Stat. 470; 13D
C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, &amp; R. Freer, Federal Prac-
tice and Procedure §3561, p. 163 (3d ed. 2008) (hereinafter
Wright &amp; Miller). We hold, therefore, that federal and
state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over private suits
arising under the TCPA.

   In enacting the TCPA, Congress made several findings
relevant here. “Unrestricted telemarketing,” Congress
determined, “can be an intrusive invasion of privacy.”
TCPA, 105 Stat. 2394, note following </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">47</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §227
(Congressional Findings) (internal quotation marks omit-
ted). In particular, Congress reported, “[m]any consumers
are outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance
[telemarketing] calls to their homes.” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="ibid_token">Ibid.</span> (internal
quotation marks </span><pre class="inline">omitted). “[A]utomated or prerecorded
telephone calls” made to private residences, Congress
found, were rightly regarded by recipients as “an invasion
of privacy.” </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="ibid_token">Ibid.</span> (internal quotation marks </span><pre class="inline">omitted).
Although over half the States had enacted statutes re-
stricting telemarketing, Congress believed that federal
law was needed because “telemarketers [could] evade
[state-law] prohibitions through interstate operations.”
</pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="ibid_token">Ibid.</span> (internal quotation marks </span><pre class="inline">omitted). See also S. Rep.
No. 102–178, p. 3 (1991) (“[B]ecause States do not have
jurisdiction over interstate calls[,] [m]any States have
expressed a desire for Federal legislation . . . .”).1
   Subject to exceptions not pertinent here, the TCPA prin-
cipally outlaws four practices. First, the Act makes it
unlawful to use an automatic telephone dialing system
or an artificial or prerecorded voice message, without the
prior express consent of the called party, to call any emer-
gency telephone line, hospital patient, pager, cellular
telephone, or other service for which the receiver is
charged for the call. See </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">47</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §227(b)(1)(A). Sec-

                          Opinion of the Court

ond, the TCPA forbids using artificial or prerecorded
voice messages to call residential telephone lines with-
out prior express consent. §227(b)(1)(B). Third, the Act
proscribes sending unsolicited advertisements to fax ma-
chines. §227(b)(1)(C). Fourth, it bans using automatic
telephone dialing systems to engage two or more of a
business’ telephone lines simultaneously. §227(b)(1)(D).2
   The TCPA delegates authority to the FCC to ban ar-
tificial and prerecorded voice calls to businesses,
§227(b)(2)(A), and to exempt particular types of calls from
the law’s requirements, §§227(b)(2)(B), (C). The Act also
directs the FCC to prescribe regulations to protect the
privacy of residential telephone subscribers, possibly
through the creation of a national “do not call” system.
§227(c).3
   Congress provided complementary means of enforcing
the Act. State Attorneys General may “bring a civil action
on behalf of [State] residents,” if the Attorney General
“has reason to believe that any person has engaged . . . in
a pattern or practice” of violating the TCPA or FCC regu-
lations thereunder. </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">47</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. A. §227(g)(1) (Supp. 2011).
“The district courts of the United States . . . have exclusive
jurisdiction” over all TCPA actions brought by State At-
torneys General. §227(g)(2). The Commission may inter-
vene in such suits. §227(g)(3).4

  2 In 2010, Congress amended the statute to prohibit an additional

practice: the manipulation of caller-identification information. See

   We are not persuaded, moreover, that Congress sought
only to fill a gap in the States’ enforcement capabilities.
Had Congress so limited its sights, it could have passed
a statute providing that out-of-state telemarketing calls
directed into a State would be subject to the laws of the
receiving State. Congress did not enact such a law. In-
stead, it enacted detailed, uniform, federal substantive
prescriptions and provided for a regulatory regime admin-

  Arrow emphasizes a statement made on the Senate floor
by Senator Hollings, the TCPA’s sponsor:
        “Computerized calls are the scourge of modern civi-
     lization. They wake us up in the morning; they in-
     terrupt our dinner at night; they force the sick and
     elderly out of bed; they hound us until we want to
     rip the telephone right out of the wall.
        .            .          .          .           .
        “The substitute bill contains a private right-of-
     action provision that will make it easier for consumers
     to recover damages from receiving these computerized
     calls. The provision would allow consumers to bring
     an action in State court against any entity that vio-
     lates the bill. The bill does not, because of constitu-
     tional constraints, dictate to the States which court in
     each State shall be the proper venue for such an ac-
     tion, as this is a matter for State legislators to deter-
     mine. Nevertheless, it is my hope that States will
     make it as easy as possible for consumers to bring
     such actions, preferably in small claims court. . . .
        “Small claims court or a similar court would allow
     the consumer to appear before the court without an
     attorney. The amount of damages in this legislation
     is set to be fair to both the consumer and the telemar-
     keter. However, it would defeat the purposes of the
     bill if the attorneys’ costs to consumers of bringing an
     action were greater than the potential damages. I
     thus expect that the States will act reasonably in
     permitting their citizens to go to court to enforce this
     bill.” 137 Cong. Rec. 30821–30822 (1991).
This statement does not bear the weight Arrow would
place on it.

18       MIMS v. ARROW FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC

                     Opinion of the Court

under </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">28</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">C</span></span><pre class="inline">. §1331. In the absence of direction from
Congress stronger than any Arrow has advanced, we apply
the familiar default rule: Federal courts have §1331 juris-
diction over claims that arise under federal law. Because
federal law gives rise to the claim for relief Mims has
stated and specifies the substantive rules of decision, the
Eleventh Circuit erred in dismissing Mims’s case for lack
of subject-matter jurisdiction.
                        *     * *
  For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is re-
versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
                                          It is so ordered.
