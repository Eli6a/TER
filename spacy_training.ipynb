C. § 2254(b)(1), thereby giving the State the \"`\"opportunity to pass upon and correct\" alleged violations of its prisoners\\' federal rights.\\'\"', 'Duncan v. Henry, 513 U. S. 364 , 365 (1995) (per curiam) (quoting Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S. 270 , 275 (1971)).', 'To provide the State with the necessary \"opportunity,\" the prisoner must \"fairly present\" his claim in each appropriate state court (including a state supreme court with powers of discretionary review), thereby alerting that court to the federal nature of the claim.', \"Duncan, supra, at 365-366; O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838 , 845 (1999).\", 'This case focuses upon the requirement of \"fair presentation.\"', \"Michael Reese, the respondent, appealed his state-court kidnaping and attempted sodomy convictions and sentences through Oregon's state court system.\", 'He then brought collateral relief proceedings in the state courts (where he was represented by appointed counsel).', 'After the lower courts denied him collateral relief, Reese filed a petition for discretionary review in the Oregon Supreme Court.', 'The petition made several different legal claims.', 'In relevant part, the petition asserted that Reese had received \"ineffective assistance of both trial court and appellate court counsel.\"', 'App.', '47.', 'The petition added that \"his imprisonment *30 is in violation of [Oregon state law].\"', 'Id., at 48.', \"It said that his trial counsel's conduct violated several provisions of the Federal Constitution.\", 'Ibid.', 'But it did not say that his separate appellate \"ineffective assistance\" claim violated federal law.', 'The Oregon Supreme Court denied review.', 'Reese ultimately sought a federal writ of habeas corpus, raising, among other claims, a federal constitutional claim that his appellate counsel did not effectively represent him during one of his direct state-court appeals.', 'The Federal District Court held that Reese had not \"fairly presented\" his federal \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim to the higher state courts because his brief in the state appeals court had not indicated that he was complaining about a violation of federal law.', 'A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court.', '282 F. 3d 1184 (2002).', 'Although the majority apparently believed that Reese\\'s petition itself did not alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of the appellate \"ineffective assistance\" claim, it did not find that fact determinative.', 'Id., at 1193-1194.', 'Rather, it found that Reese had satisfied the \"fair presentation\" requirement because the justices of the Oregon Supreme Court had had \"the opportunity to read .', '.', '.', 'the lower [Oregon] court decision claimed to be in error before deciding whether to grant discretionary review.\"', 'Id., at 1194 (emphasis added).', \"Had they read the opinion of the lower state trial court, the majority added, the justices would have, or should have, realized that Reese's claim rested upon federal law.\", 'Ibid.', 'We granted certiorari to determine whether the Ninth Circuit has correctly interpreted the \"fair presentation\" requirement.', \"We begin by assuming that Reese's petition by itself did not properly alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of Reese's claim.\", 'On that assumption, Reese failed *31 to meet the \"fair presentation\" standard, and the Ninth Circuit was wrong to hold the contrary.', 'We recognize that the justices of the Oregon Supreme Court did have an \"opportunity\" to read the lower court opinions in Reese\\'s case.', 'That opportunity means that the judges could have read them.', 'But to say that a petitioner \"fairly presents\" a federal claim when an appellate judge can discover that claim only by reading lower court opinions in the case is to say that those judges must read the lower court opinions \\x97 for otherwise they would forfeit the State\\'s opportunity to decide that federal claim in the first instance.', 'In our view, federal habeas corpus law does not impose such a requirement.', 'For one thing, the requirement would force state appellate judges to alter their ordinary review practices.', 'Appellate judges, of course, will often read lower court opinions, but they do not necessarily do so in every case.', 'Sometimes an appellate court can decide a legal question on the basis of the briefs alone.', 'That is particularly so where the question at issue is whether to exercise a discretionary power of review, i. e., whether to review the merits of a lower court decision.', 'In such instances, the nature of the issue may matter more than does the legal validity of the lower court decision.', 'And the nature of the issue alone may lead the court to decide not to hear the case.', 'Indeed, the Oregon Supreme Court is a court with a discretionary power of review.', 'And Oregon Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.05(7) (2003) instructs litigants seeking discretionary review to identify clearly in the petition itself the legal questions presented, why those questions have special importance, a short statement of relevant facts, and the reasons for reversal, \"including appropriate authorities.\"', 'For another thing, the opinion-reading requirement would impose a serious burden upon judges of state appellate courts, particularly those with discretionary review powers.', 'Those courts have heavy workloads, which would be significantly *32 increased if their judges had to read through lower court opinions or briefs in every instance.', 'See National Center for State Courts, State Court Caseload Statistics 2002, pp.', '106-110 (Table 2) Finally, we do not find such a requirement necessary to avoid imposing unreasonable procedural burdens upon state prisoners who may eventually seek habeas corpus.', 'A litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief, for example, by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim \"federal.\"', 'For these reasons, we believe that the requirement imposed by the Ninth Circuit would unjustifiably undercut the considerations of federal-state comity that the exhaustion requirement seeks to promote.', 'We consequently hold that ordinarily a state prisoner does not \"fairly present\" a claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition or a brief (or a similar document) that does not alert it to the presence of a federal claim in order to find material, such as a lower court opinion in the case, that does so.', 'Reese argues in the alternative that it is wrong to assume that his petition by itself failed to alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of his \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim.', 'We do not agree.', 'Reese must concede that his petition does not explicitly say that the words \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" refer to a federal claim.', 'The petition refers to provisions of the Federal Constitution in respect to other claims but not in respect to this one.', 'The petition provides no citation of any case that might have alerted the court to the alleged federal nature of the claim.', 'And the petition does not even contain a factual description supporting the claim.', 'Cf.', 'Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152 , 163 (1996); Duncan, 513 U. S., at 366 .', 'Reese asserts that the petition nonetheless \"fairly presents\" a federal \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim for two reasons.', 'First, he says that the word \"ineffective\" is a term of art in Oregon that refers only to federal-law claims and not to similar state-law claims, which, he adds, in Oregon are solely referred to as \"inadequate assistance\" claims.', 'And thus the Oregon Supreme Court should have known, from his use of the word \"ineffective,\" that his claim was federal.', 'Reese, however, has not demonstrated that Oregon law uses the words \"ineffective assistance\" in the manner he suggests, that is, as referring only to a federal-law claim.', 'See, e. g., Lichau v. Baldwin, 166 Ore. App.', '411, 415, 417, 999 P. 2d 1207 , 1210, 1211 (2000) (using \"ineffective assistance\" to refer to violations of the Oregon Constitution) ev\\'d in part, 333 Ore. 350 , 39 P. 3d 851 (2002).', 'Indeed, Reese\\'s own petition uses both phrases \\x97 \"ineffective assistance\" and \"inadequate assistance\" \\x97 at different points to refer to what is apparently a single claim.', 'Second, Reese says that in Oregon the standards for adjudicating state and federal \"inadequate/ineffective appellate assistance\" claims are identical.', 'He adds that, where that identity exists, a petitioner need not indicate a claim\\'s federal nature, because, by raising a state-law claim, he would necessarily \"fairly present\" the corresponding federal claim.', '*34 However, the Ninth Circuit did not address this argument, and our reading of the briefs filed in the Ninth Circuit leads us to conclude that Reese did not there seek consideration of the argument in that court.', \"Indeed, the argument first made its appearance in this Court in Reese's brief on the merits.\", 'Under this Court\\'s Rule 15.2, \"a nonjurisdictional argument not raised in a respondent\\'s brief in opposition to a petition for a writ of certiorari may be deemed waived.\"', 'Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61 , 75, n. 13 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'This argument falls squarely within the rule.', \"The complex nature of Reese's claim and its broad implications suggest that its consideration by the lower courts would help in its resolution.\", 'Hence, without expressing any view on the merits of the issue, we exercise our Rule 15.2 discretion and deem the argument waived in this Court.', 'See, e. g., Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U. S. 249 , 253-254 (1999) (per curiam); South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U. S. 160 , 171 (1999); cf.', 'Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U.

Krivda, 5 Cal.', '3d 357 , 486 P.2d 1262 (1971), which held that warrantless trash searches violate the Fourth Amendment and the California Constitution.', 'The court found that the police would not have had probable cause to search the Greenwood home without the evidence obtained from the trash searches.', 'The Court of Appeal affirmed.', '182 Cal.', 'App.', '3d 729, 227 Cal.', 'Rptr.', '539 (1986).', 'The court noted at the outset that the fruits of warrantless trash searches could no longer be suppressed if Krivda were based only on the California Constitution, because since 1982 the State has barred the suppression of evidence seized in violation of California law but not federal law.', 'See Cal.', 'Const., Art.', 'I, § 28(d); In re Lance W., 37 Cal.', '3d 873 , 694 P.2d 744 (1985).', 'But Krivda, a decision binding on the Court of Appeal, also held that the fruits of warrantless trash searches were to be excluded under federal *39 law.', 'Hence, the Superior Court was correct in dismissing the charges against respondents.', '182 Cal.', 'App.', \"3d, at 735 , The California Supreme Court denied the State's petition for review of the Court of Appeal's decision.\", 'We granted certiorari, 483 U.S. 1019, and now reverse.', 'The warrantless search and seizure of the garbage bags left at the curb outside the Greenwood house would violate the Fourth Amendment only if respondents manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in their garbage that society accepts as objectively reasonable.', \"O'Connor v.

Reicherter, 647 F.2d 397 , 399 (CA3 1981), respondents could have had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the inculpatory items that they discarded.', 'Furthermore, as we have held, the police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by any member of the public.', 'Hence, \"[w]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\"', 'Katz v. United States, supra, at 351.', \"We held in Smith v.

      "Segmentation ['JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.', 'These cases involve 42 U.S. C .', '§262(l), which was en- acted as part of the Biologics Price Competition and Inno- vation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), 124 Stat.', '808.', 'The BPCIA governs a type of drug called a biosimilar, which is a biologic product that is highly similar to a biologic product that has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).', 'Under §262(l), an applicant that seeks FDA approval of a biosimilar must provide its appli- cation materials and manufacturing information to the manufacturer of the corresponding biologic within 20 days of the date the FDA notifies the applicant that it has accepted the application for review.', 'The applicant then must give notice to the manufacturer at least 180 days before marketing the biosimilar commercially.', 'The first question presented by these cases is whether the requirement that an applicant provide its application and manufacturing information to the manufacturer of the biologic is enforceable by injunction.', 'We conclude that an injunction is not available under federal law, but we re- mand for the court below to decide whether an injunction is available under state law.', 'The second question is whether the applicant must give notice to the manufac- turer after, rather than before, obtaining a license from the FDA for its biosimilar.', 'We conclude that an applicant may provide notice before obtaining a license.', 'We conclude that an applicant may provide notice before obtaining a license.', 'The complex statutory scheme at issue in these cases establishes processes both for obtaining FDA approval of biosimilars and for resolving patent disputes between manufacturers of licensed biologics and manufacturers of biosimilars.', 'Before turning to the questions presented, we first explain the statutory background.', 'A biologic is a type of drug derived from natural, biologi- cal sources such as animals or microorganisms.', 'iologics thus differ from traditional drugs, which are typically synthesized from chemicals.1 A manufacturer of a biologic may market the drug only if the FDA has licensed it pur- suant to either of two review processes set forth in §262.', 'The default pathway for approval, used for new biologics, is set forth in §262(a).', 'Under that subsection, the FDA may license a new biologic if, among other things, the manufacturer demonstrates that it is “safe, pure, and potent.” §262(a)(2)(C)(i)(I).', 'In addition to this default route, the statute also prescribes an alternative, abbrevi- ated route for FDA approval of biosimilars, which is set forth in §262(k).', 'To obtain approval through the BPCIA’s abbreviated process, the manufacturer of a biosimilar (applicant) does not need to show that the product is “safe, pure, and po- tent.” Instead, the applicant may piggyback on the show- ing made by the manufacturer (sponsor) of a previously licensed biologic (reference product).', 'See §262(k)(2)(A)(iii).', 'An applicant must show that its product is “highly simi- lar” to the reference product and that there are no “clini- cally meaningful differences” between the two in terms of “safety, purity, and potency.” §§262(i)(2)(A), (B) see also §262(k)(2)(A)(i)(I).', 'An applicant may not submit an appli- cation until 4 years after the reference product is first licensed, and the FDA may not license a biosimilar until 12 years after the reference product is first licensed.', '§§262(k)(7)(A), (B).', 'As a result, the manufacturer of a new biologic enjoys a 12-year period when its biologic may be marketed without competition from biosimilars.', 'A sponsor may hold multiple patents covering the bio- logic, its therapeutic uses, and the processes used to man- ufacture it.', 'Those patents may constrain an applicant’s ability to market its biosimilar even after the expiration of the 12-year exclusivity period contained in §262(k)(7)(A).', 'The BPCIA facilitates litigation during the period pre- ceding FDA approval so that the parties do not have to wait until commercial marketing to resolve their patent disputes.', 'It enables the parties to bring infringement actions at certain points in the application process, even if the applicant has not yet committed an act that would traditionally constitute patent infringement.', 'See 35 U.S. C .', '§271(a) (traditionally infringing acts include making, using, offering to sell, or selling any patented invention within the United States without authority to do so).', 'See 35 U.S. C .', '§271(a) (traditionally infringing acts include making, using, offering to sell, or selling any patented invention within the United States without authority to do so).', 'Specifically, it provides that the mere submission of a biosimilar application constitutes an act of infringement.', '§§271(e)(2)(C)(i), (ii).', 'We will refer to this kind of preap- proval infringement as “artificial” infringement.', 'Section 271(e)(4) provides remedies for artificial infringement, including injunctive relief and damages.', 'The BPCIA sets forth a carefully calibrated scheme for preparing to adjudicate, and then adjudicating, claims of infringement.', 'See 42 U.S. C .', '§262(l).', 'When the FDA accepts an application for review, it notifies the applicant, who within 20 days “shall provide” to the sponsor a copy of the application and information about how the biosimilar is manufactured.', '§262(l)(2)(A).', 'The applicant also “may provide” the sponsor with any additional information that it requests.', '§262(l)(2)(B).', 'These disclosures enable the sponsor to evaluate the biosimilar for possible infringe- ment of patents it holds on the reference product (i.e., the corresponding biologic).', '§262(l)(1)(D).', 'The information the applicant provides is subject to strict confidentiality rules, enforceable by injunction.', 'See §262(l)(1)(H).', 'The first question presented by these cases is whether §262(l)(2)(A)’s requirement—that the applicant provide its application and manufacturing information to the spon- sor—is itself enforceable by injunction.', 'After the applicant makes the requisite disclosures, the parties exchange information to identify relevant patents and to flesh out the legal arguments that they might raise in future litigation.', 'Within 60 days of receiving the appli- cation and manufacturing information, the sponsor “shall provide” to the applicant “a list of patents” for which it believes it could assert an infringement claim if a person without a license made, used, offered to sell, sold, or im- ported “the biological product that is the subject of the [biosimilar] application.” §262(l)(3)(A)(i).', 'The sponsor must also identify any patents on the list that it would be willing to license.', '§262(l)(3)(A)(ii).', 'Next, within 60 days of receiving the sponsor’s list, the applicant may provide to the sponsor a list of patents that the applicant believes are relevant but that the sponsor omitted from its own list, §262(l)(3)(B)(i), and “shall pro- vide” to the sponsor reasons why it could not be held liable for infringing the relevant patents, §262(l)(3)(B)(ii).', 'The applicant may argue that the relevant patents are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, or the applicant may agree not to market the biosimilar until a particular pat- ent has expired.', 'Ibid.', 'The applicant must also respond to the sponsor’s offers to license particular patents.', '§262(l)(3)(B)(iii).', 'Then, within 60 days of receiving the applicant’s responses, the sponsor “shall provide” to the applicant its own arguments concerning infringement, enforceability, and validity as to each relevant patent.', '§262(l)(3)(C).', 'Following this exchange, the BPCIA channels the par- ties into two phases of patent litigation.', 'In the first phase, the parties collaborate to identify patents that they would like to litigate immediately.', 'The second phase is triggered by the applicant’s notice of commercial marketing and involves any patents that were included on the parties’ §262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase.', 'The second phase is triggered by the applicant’s notice of commercial marketing and involves any patents that were included on the parties’ §262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase.', 'At the outset of the first phase, the applicant and the sponsor must negotiate to determine which patents in- cluded on the §262(l)(3) lists will be litigated immediately.', 'See §§262(l)(4)(A), (l)(6).', 'If they cannot agree, then they must engage in another list exchange.', '§262(l)(4)(B).', 'The applicant “shall notify” the sponsor of the number of pat- ents it intends to list for litigation, §262(l)(5)(A), and, within five days, the parties “shall simultaneously ex- change” lists of the patents they would like to litigate immediately.', '§262(l)(5)(B)(i).', 'This process gives the applicant substantial control over the scope of the first phase of litigation: The number of patents on the sponsor’s list is limited to the number contained in the applicant’s list, though the sponsor always has the right to list at least one patent.', '§262(l)(5)(B)(ii).', 'The parties then proceed to litigate infringement with respect to the patents they agreed to litigate or, if they failed to agree, the patents contained on the lists they simultaneously exchanged under §262(l)(5).', '§§262(l)(6)(A), (B).', 'Section 271(e)(2)(C)(i) facilitates this first phase of litigation by making it an act of artificial infringement, with respect to any patent included on the parties’ §262(l)(3) lists, to submit an application for a license from the FDA.', 'The sponsor “shall bring an action” in court within 30 days of the date of agreement or the simultane- ous list exchange.', '§§262(l)(6)(A), (B).', 'If the sponsor brings a timely action and prevails, it may obtain a rem- edy provided by §271(e)(4).', 'The second phase of litigation involves patents that were included on the original §262(l)(3) lists but not liti- gated in the first phase (and any patents that the sponsor acquired after the §262(l)(3) exchange occurred and added to the lists, see §262(l)(7)).', 'The second phase is com- menced by the applicant’s notice of commercial marketing, which the applicant “shall provide” to the sponsor “not later than 180 days before the date of the first commercial marketing of the biological product licensed under subsec- tion (k).” §262(l)(8)(A).', 'The BPCIA bars any declaratory judgment action prior to this notice.', '§262(l)(9)(A) (prohib- iting, in situations where the parties have complied with each step of the BPCIA process, either the sponsor or the applicant from seeking a “declaration of infringement, validity, or enforceability of any patent” that was included on the §262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase “prior to the date notice is received under paragraph (8)(A)”).', '§262(l)(9)(A) (prohib- iting, in situations where the parties have complied with each step of the BPCIA process, either the sponsor or the applicant from seeking a “declaration of infringement, validity, or enforceability of any patent” that was included on the §262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase “prior to the date notice is received under paragraph (8)(A)”).', 'Because the applicant (subject to certain con- straints) chooses when to begin commercial marketing and when to give notice, it wields substantial control over the timing of the second phase of litigation.', 'Because the applicant (subject to certain con- straints) chooses when to begin commercial marketing and when to give notice, it wields substantial control over the timing of the second phase of litigation.', 'The second ques- tion presented is whether notice is effective if an appli- cant provides it prior to the FDA’s decision to license the biosimilar.', 'In this second phase of litigation, either party may sue for declaratory relief.', 'See §262(l)(9)(A).', 'In addition, prior to the date of first commercial marketing, the sponsor may “seek a preliminary injunction prohibiting the [biosimilar] applicant from engaging in the commercial manufacture or sale of [the biosimilar] until the court decides the issue of patent validity, enforcement, and infringement with respect to any patent that” was included on the §262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase.', '§262(l)(8)(B).', 'If the parties comply with each step outlined in the BPCIA, they will have the opportunity to litigate the relevant patents before the biosimilar is marketed.', 'To encourage parties to comply with its procedural require- ments, the BPCIA includes various consequences for failing to do so.', 'Two of the BPCIA’s remedial provisions are at issue here.', 'Under §262(l)(9)(C), if an applicant fails to provide its application and manufacturing information to the sponsor—thus effectively pretermitting the entire two-phase litigation process—then the sponsor, but not the applicant, may immediately bring an action “for a declaration of infringement, validity, or enforceability of any patent that claims the biological product or a use of the biological product.” Section 271(e)(2)(C)(ii) facilitates this action by making it an artificial act of infringement, with respect to any patent that could have been included on the §262(l)(3) lists, to submit a biosimilar application.', 'Similarly, when an applicant provides the application and manufacturing information but fails to complete a subse- quent step, §262(l)(9)(B) provides that the sponsor, but not the applicant, may bring a declaratory-judgment action with respect to any patent included on the sponsor’s §262(l)(3)(A) list of patents (as well as those it acquired later and added to the list).', 'As noted, it is an act of artifi- cial infringement, with respect to any patent on the §262(l)(3) lists, to submit an application to the FDA.', 'See §271(e)(2)(C)(i).', 'See §271(e)(2)(C)(i).', 'These cases concern

work on the theory that the performance of such work during a strike is an activity furthering management's interests.\", '[13] *803 We agree with the Court of Appeals that § 8 (b) (1) (B) cannot be so broadly read.', 'Both the language and the legislative history of § 8 (b) (1) (B) reflect a clearly focused congressional concern with the protection of employers in the selection of representatives to engage in two particular and explicitly stated activities, namely collective bargaining and the adjustment of grievances.', 'By its terms, the statute proscribes only union restraint or coercion of an employer \"in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances,\" and the legislative history makes clear that in enacting the provision Congress was exclusively concerned with union attempts to dictate to employers who would represent them in collective bargaining and grievance adjustment.', 'The specific concern of Congress was to prevent unions from trying to force employers into or out of multi-employer bargaining units.', '[14] As Senator Taft, cosponsor of the legislation, explained: \"Under this provision it would be impossible for a union to say to a company, `We will not bargain with you unless you appoint your national employers\\' association as your agent so that we can bergain nationally.\\'', 'Under the bill the employer has a right to say, `No, I will not join in national bargaining.', \"Here is my representative, and this is the man you have to deal with.'\", 'I believe the provision is a necessary one, and one which will accomplish substantially wise purposes.\"', '93 Cong.', 'Rec.', '3837.', '*804 That the legislative creation of this unfair labor practice was in no sense intended to cut the broad swath attributed to it by the Board in the present cases is pointed up by the further observation of Senator Taft \"This unfair labor practice referred to is not perhaps of tremendous importance, but employees cannot say to their employer, `we do not like Mr. X, we will not meet Mr. X.', 'You have to send us Mr.', \"Y.'\", 'That has been done.', 'It would prevent their saying to the employer, `You have to fire Foreman Jones.', \"We do not like Foreman Jones, and therefore you will have to fire him, or we will not go to work.'\", '\" 93 Cong.', 'Rec.', '3837.', '[15] Nowhere in the legislative history is there to be found any implication that Congress sought to extend protection to the employer from union restraint or coercion when engaged in any activity other than the selection of its representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining and grievance adjustment.', \"The conclusion is thus inescapable that a union's discipline of one of its members who is a supervisory employee can constitute a violation of § 8 (b) (1) (B) only when that discipline may *805 adversely affect the supervisor's conduct in performing the duties of, and acting in his capacity as, grievance adjuster or collective bargainer on behalf of the employer.\", \"We may assume without deciding that the Board's Oakland Mailers decision fell within the outer limits of this test, but its decisions in the present cases clearly do not.\", 'For it is certain that these supervisors were not engaged in collective bargaining or grievance adjustment, or in any activities related thereto, when they crossed union picket lines during an economic strike to engage in rank-and-file struck work.', '[16] It is strenuously asserted, however, that to permit a union to discipline supervisor-members for performing *806 rank-and-file work during an economic strike will deprive the employer of the full loyalty of those supervisors.', 'Indeed, it is precisely that concern that is reflected in these and other recent decisions of the Board holding that the statutory language \"restrain or coerce .', '.', '.', 'an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances\" is not confined to situations in which the union\\'s object is to force a change in the identity of the employer\\'s representatives, but may properly be read to encompass any situation in which the union\\'s actions are likely to deprive the employer of the undivided loyalty of his supervisory employees.', 'As the Board stated in Wisconsin Electric: \"During the strike of the Union, the Employer clearly considered its supervisors among those it could depend on during this period.', \"The Union's fining of the supervisors who were acting in the Employer's interest in performing the struck work severely jeopardized the relationship between the Employer and its supervisors.\", 'Thus, the fines, if found to be lawful, would now permit the Union to drive a wedge between a supervisor and the Employer, thus interfering with the performance of the duties the Employer had a right to expect the supervisor to perform.', 'The Employer could no longer count on the complete and undivided loyalty of those it had selected to act as its collective-bargaining agents or to act for it in adjusting grievances.', \"Moreover, such fines clearly interfere with the Employer's control over its own representatives.\", '\"The purpose of Section 8 (b) (1) (B) is to assure to the employer that its selected collective-bargaining representatives will be completely faithful to its desires.', 'This cannot be achieved if the union has an *807 effective method, union disciplinary action, by which it can pressure such representatives to deviate from the interests of the employer.\"', '192 N. L. R. B., at 78.', 'The Board in the present cases echoes this view in arguing that \"where a supervisor is disciplined by the union for performing other supervisory or management functions, the likely effect of such discipline is to make him subservient to the union\\'s wishes when he performs those functions in the future.', 'Thus, even if the effect of this discipline did not carry over to the performance of the supervisor\\'s grievance adjustment or collective bargaining functions, the result would be to deprive the employer of the full allegiance of, and control over, a representative he has selected for grievance adjustment or collective bargaining purposes.\"', 'Brief for Petitioner in No.', '73-795, p. 34.', 'The concern expressed in this argument is a very real one, but the problem is one that Congress addressed, not through § 8 (b) (1) (B), but through a completely different legislative route.', 'Specifically, Congress in 1947 amended the definition of \"employee\" in § 2 (3), 29 U.S. C. § 152 (3), to exclude those denominated supervisors under § 2 (11), 29 U.S. C. § 152 (11), thereby excluding them from the coverage of the Act.', '[17] See *808 NLRB v.

that claim only by reading lower court opinions in the case is to say that those judges must read the lower court opinions \\x97 for otherwise they would forfeit the State\\'s opportunity to decide that federal claim in the first instance.', 'In our view, federal habeas corpus law does not impose such a requirement.', 'For one thing, the requirement would force state appellate judges to alter their ordinary review practices.', 'Appellate judges, of course, will often read lower court opinions, but they do not necessarily do so in every case.', 'Sometimes an appellate court can decide a legal question on the basis of the briefs alone.', 'That is particularly so where the question at issue is whether to exercise a discretionary power of review, i. e., whether to review the merits of a lower court decision.', 'In such instances, the nature of the issue may matter more than does the legal validity of the lower court decision.', 'And the nature of the issue alone may lead the court to decide not to hear the case.', 'Indeed, the Oregon Supreme Court is a court with a discretionary power of review.', 'And Oregon Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.05(7) (2003) instructs litigants seeking discretionary review to identify clearly in the petition itself the legal questions presented, why those questions have special importance, a short statement of relevant facts, and the reasons for reversal, \"including appropriate authorities.\"', 'For another thing, the opinion-reading requirement would impose a serious burden upon judges of state appellate courts, particularly those with discretionary review powers.', 'Those courts have heavy workloads, which would be significantly *32 increased if their judges had to read through lower court opinions or briefs in every instance.', 'See National Center for State Courts, State Court Caseload Statistics 2002, pp.', '106-110 (Table 2) Finally, we do not find such a requirement necessary to avoid imposing unreasonable procedural burdens upon state prisoners who may eventually seek habeas corpus.', 'A litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief, for example, by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim \"federal.\"', 'For these reasons, we believe that the requirement imposed by the Ninth Circuit would unjustifiably undercut the considerations of federal-state comity that the exhaustion requirement seeks to promote.', 'We consequently hold that ordinarily a state prisoner does not \"fairly present\" a claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition or a brief (or a similar document) that does not alert it to the presence of a federal claim in order to find material, such as a lower court opinion in the case, that does so.', 'Reese argues in the alternative that it is wrong to assume that his petition by itself failed to alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of his \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim.', 'We do not agree.', 'Reese must concede that his petition does not explicitly say that the words \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" refer to a federal claim.', 'The petition refers to provisions of the Federal Constitution in respect to other claims but not in respect to this one.', 'The petition provides no citation of any case that might have alerted the court to the alleged federal nature of the claim.',

Act of 2009 (BPCIA), 124 Stat.', '808.', 'The BPCIA governs a type of drug called a biosimilar, which is a biologic product that is highly similar to a biologic product that has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).', 'Under §262(l), an applicant that seeks FDA approval of a biosimilar must provide its appli- cation materials and manufacturing information to the manufacturer of the corresponding biologic within 20 days of the date the FDA notifies the applicant that it has accepted the application for review.', 'The applicant then must give notice to the manufacturer at least 180 days before marketing the biosimilar commercially.', 'The first question presented by these cases is whether the requirement that an applicant provide its application and manufacturing information to the manufacturer of the biologic is enforceable by injunction.', 'We conclude that an injunction is not available under federal law, but we re- mand for the court below to decide whether an injunction is available under state law.', 'The second question is whether the applicant must give notice to the manufac- turer after, rather than before, obtaining a license from the FDA for its biosimilar.', 'We conclude that an applicant may provide notice before obtaining a license.', 'We conclude that an applicant may provide notice before obtaining a license.', 'The complex statutory scheme at issue in these cases establishes processes both for obtaining FDA approval of biosimilars and for resolving patent disputes between manufacturers of licensed biologics and manufacturers of biosimilars.', 'Before turning to the questions presented, we first explain the statutory background.', 'A biologic is a type of drug derived from natural, biologi- cal sources such as animals or microorganisms.', 'iologics thus differ from traditional drugs, which are typically synthesized from chemicals.1 A manufacturer of a biologic may market the drug only if the FDA has licensed it pur- suant to either of two review processes set forth in §262.', 'The default pathway for approval, used for new biologics, is set forth in §262(a).', 'Under that subsection, the FDA may license a new biologic if, among other things, the manufacturer demonstrates that it is “safe, pure, and potent.” §', '262(a)(2)(C)(i)(I).', 'In addition to this default route, the statute also prescribes an alternative, abbrevi- ated route for FDA approval of biosimilars, which is set forth in §262(k).', 'To obtain approval through the BPCIA’s abbreviated process, the manufacturer of a biosimilar (applicant) does not need to show that the product is “safe, pure, and po- tent.”', 'Instead, the applicant may piggyback on the show- ing made by the manufacturer (sponsor) of a previously licensed biologic (reference product).', 'See §262(k)(2)(A)(iii).', 'An applicant must show that its product is “highly simi- lar” to the reference product and that there are no “clini- cally meaningful differences” between the two in terms of “safety, purity, and potency.” §§', '262(i)(2)(A), (B) see also §262(k)(2)(A)(i)(I).', 'An applicant may not submit an appli- cation until 4 years after the reference product is first licensed, and the FDA may not license a biosimilar until 12 years after the reference product is first licensed. §§', '262(k)(7)(A), (B).', 'As a result, the manufacturer of a new biologic enjoys a 12-year period when its biologic may be marketed without competition from biosimilars.', 'A sponsor may hold multiple patents covering the bio- logic, its therapeutic uses, and the processes used to man- ufacture it.', 'Those patents may constrain an applicant’s ability to market its biosimilar even after the expiration of the 12-year exclusivity period contained in §262(k)(7)(A).', 'The BPCIA facilitates litigation during the period pre- ceding FDA approval so that the parties do not have to wait until commercial marketing to resolve their patent disputes.', 'It enables the parties to bring infringement actions at certain points in the application process, even if the applicant has not yet committed an act that would traditionally constitute patent infringement.', 'See 35 U.S. C . §', '271(a) (traditionally infringing acts include making, using, offering to sell, or selling any patented invention within the United States without authority to do so).', 'See 35 U.S. C . §', '271(a) (traditionally infringing acts include making, using, offering to sell, or selling any patented invention within the United States without authority to do so).', 'Specifically, it provides that the mere submission of a biosimilar application constitutes an act of infringement. §§', '271(e)(2)(C)(i), (ii).', 'We will refer to this kind of preap- proval infringement as “artificial” infringement.', 'Section 271(e)(4) provides remedies for artificial infringement, including injunctive relief and damages.', 'The BPCIA sets forth a carefully calibrated scheme for preparing to adjudicate, and then adjudicating, claims of infringement.', 'See 42 U.S. C . §', '262(l).', 'When the FDA accepts an application for review, it notifies the applicant, who within 20 days “shall provide” to the sponsor a copy of the application and information about how the biosimilar is manufactured. §', '262(l)(2)(A).', 'The applicant also “may provide” the sponsor with any additional information that it requests. §', '262(l)(2)(B).', 'These disclosures enable the sponsor to evaluate the biosimilar for possible infringe- ment of patents it holds on the reference product (i.e., the corresponding biologic). §', '262(l)(1)(D).', 'The information the applicant provides is subject to strict confidentiality rules, enforceable by injunction.', 'See §262(l)(1)(H).', 'The first question presented by these cases is whether §262(l)(2)(A)’s requirement—that the applicant provide its application and manufacturing information to the spon- sor—is itself enforceable by injunction.', 'After the applicant makes the requisite disclosures, the parties exchange information to identify relevant patents and to flesh out the legal arguments that they might raise in future litigation.', 'Within 60 days of receiving the appli- cation and manufacturing information, the sponsor “shall provide” to the applicant “a list of patents” for which it believes it could assert an infringement claim if a person without a license made, used, offered to sell, sold, or im- ported “the biological product that is the subject of the [biosimilar] application.” §', '262(l)(3)(A)(i).', 'The sponsor must also identify any patents on the list that it would be willing to license. §', '262(l)(3)(A)(ii).', 'Next, within 60 days of receiving the sponsor’s list, the applicant may provide to the sponsor a list of patents that the applicant believes are relevant but that the sponsor omitted from its own list, §262(l)(3)(B)(i), and “shall pro- vide” to the sponsor reasons why it could not be held liable for infringing the relevant patents, §262(l)(3)(B)(ii).', 'The applicant may argue that the relevant patents are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, or the applicant may agree not to market the biosimilar until a particular pat- ent has expired.', 'Ibid.', 'The applicant must also respond to the sponsor’s offers to license particular patents. §', '262(l)(3)(B)(iii).', 'Then, within 60 days of receiving the applicant’s responses, the sponsor “shall provide” to the applicant its own arguments concerning infringement, enforceability, and validity as to each relevant patent. §', '262(l)(3)(C).', 'Following this exchange, the BPCIA channels the par- ties into two phases of patent litigation.', 'In the first phase, the parties collaborate to identify patents that they would like to litigate immediately.', 'The second phase is triggered by the applicant’s notice of commercial marketing and involves any patents that were included on the parties’ §262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase.', 'The second phase is triggered by the applicant’s notice of commercial marketing and involves any patents that were included on the parties’ §262(l)(3) lists

immediately.', 'See §§262(l)(4)(A), (l)(6).', 'If they cannot agree, then they must engage in another list exchange. §', '262(l)(4)(B).', 'The applicant “shall notify” the sponsor of the number of pat- ents it intends to list for litigation, §262(l)(5)(A), and, within five days, the parties “shall simultaneously ex- change” lists of the patents they would like to litigate immediately. §', '262(l)(5)(B)(i).', 'This process gives the applicant substantial control over the scope of the first phase of litigation: The number of patents on the sponsor’s list is limited to the number contained in the applicant’s list, though the sponsor always has the right to list at least one patent. §', '262(l)(5)(B)(ii).', 'The parties then proceed to litigate infringement with respect to the patents they agreed to litigate or, if they failed to agree, the patents contained on the lists they simultaneously exchanged under §262(l)(5). §§', '262(l)(6)(A), (B).', 'Section 271(e)(2)(C)(i)

from the FDA.', 'The sponsor “shall bring an action” in court within 30 days of the date of agreement or the simultane- ous list exchange. §§', '262(l)(6)(A), (B).', 'If the sponsor brings a timely action and prevails, it may obtain a rem- edy provided by §271(e)(4).', 'The second phase of litigation involves patents that were included on the original §262(l)(3) lists but not liti- gated in the first phase (and any patents that the sponsor acquired after the §262(l)(3) exchange occurred and added to the lists, see §262(l)(7)).', 'The second phase is com- menced by the applicant’s notice of commercial marketing, which the applicant “shall provide” to the sponsor “not later than 180 days before the date of the first commercial marketing of the biological product licensed under subsec- tion (k).” §', '262(l)(8)(A).', 'The BPCIA bars any declaratory judgment action prior to this notice. §', '262(l)(9)(A) (prohib- iting, in situations where the parties have complied with each step of

first phase “prior to the date notice is received under paragraph (8)(A)”).', 'Because the applicant (subject to certain con- straints) chooses when to begin commercial marketing and when to give notice, it wields substantial control over the timing of the second phase of litigation.', 'Because the applicant (subject to certain con- straints) chooses when to begin commercial marketing and when to give notice, it wields substantial control over the timing of the second phase of litigation.', 'The second ques- tion presented is whether notice is effective if an appli- cant provides it prior to the FDA’s decision to license the biosimilar.', 'In this second phase of litigation, either party may sue for declaratory relief.', 'See §262(l)(9)(A).', 'In addition, prior to the date of first commercial marketing, the sponsor may “seek a preliminary injunction prohibiting the [biosimilar] applicant from engaging in the commercial manufacture or sale of [the biosimilar] until the court decides the issue of patent validity, enforcement, and infringement with respect to any patent that” was included on the §262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase. §', '262(l)(8)(B).', 'If the parties comply with each step outlined in the BPCIA, they will have the opportunity to litigate the relevant patents before the biosimilar is marketed.', 'To encourage parties to comply with its procedural require- ments, the BPCIA includes various consequences for failing to do so.', 'Two of the BPCIA’s remedial provisions are at issue here.', 'Under §262(l)(9)(C), if an applicant fails to provide its application and manufacturing information to the sponsor—thus effectively pretermitting the entire two-phase litigation process—then the sponsor, but not the applicant, may immediately bring an action “for a declaration of infringement, validity, or enforceability of any patent that claims the biological product or a use of the biological product.”', 'Section 271(e)(2)(C)(ii) facilitates this action by making it an artificial act of infringement, with respect to any patent that could have been included on the §262(l)(3) lists, to submit a biosimilar application.', 'Similarly, when an applicant provides the application and manufacturing information but fails to complete a subse- quent step, §262(l)(9)(B) provides that the sponsor, but not the applicant, may bring a declaratory-judgment action with respect to any patent included on the sponsor’s §262(l)(3)(A) list of patents (as well as those it acquired later and added to the list).', 'As noted, it is an

[', '11] These decisions reflected a further evolution of the Oakland Mailers doctrine.', 'In Oakland Mailers, the union had disciplined its supervisor-members for an alleged misinterpretation or misapplication of the collective-bargaining agreement, and the Board had reasoned that the natural and foreseeable effect of such discipline was that in interpreting the agreement in the future, the supervisor would be reluctant to take a position adverse to that of the union.', 'In the subsequent cases, *802 however, the Board held that the same coercive effect was likely to arise from the disciplining of a supervisor whenever he was engaged in management or supervisory activities, even though his collective-bargaining or grievance-adjustment duties were not involved.', 'Through the course of these decisions, § 8 (b) (1) (B) thus began to evolve in the view of the Board and the courts \"as a general prohibition of a union\\'s disciplining supervisor-members for their conduct in the course of representing the interests of their employers.\"', 'Toledo Locals Nos.', '15-P & 272, Lithographers & Photoengravers International, 175 N.

[', \"12] In the present cases, the Board has extended that doctrine to hold that § 8 (b) (1) (B) forbids union discipline of supervisors for performance of rank-and-file work on the theory that the performance of such work during a strike is an activity furthering management's interests. [\", '13] *803 We agree with the Court of Appeals that § 8 (b) (1) (B) cannot be so broadly read.', 'Both the language and the legislative history of § 8 (b) (1) (B) reflect a clearly focused congressional concern with the protection of employers in the selection of representatives to engage in two particular and explicitly stated activities, namely collective bargaining and the adjustment of grievances.', 'By its terms, the statute proscribes only union restraint or coercion of an employer \"in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances,\" and the legislative history makes clear that in enacting the provision Congress was exclusively concerned with union attempts to dictate to employers who would represent them in collective bargaining and grievance adjustment.', 'The specific concern of Congress was to prevent unions from trying to force employers into or out of multi-employer bargaining units. [', '14] As Senator Taft, cosponsor of the legislation, explained: \"Under this provision it would be impossible for a union to say to a company, `We will not bargain with you unless you appoint your national employers\\' association as your agent so that we can bergain nationally.\\'', 'Under the bill the employer has a right to say, `No, I will not join in national bargaining.', \"Here is my representative, and this is the man you have to deal with.'\", 'I believe the provision is a necessary one, and one which will accomplish substantially wise purposes.\"', '93 Cong.', 'Rec.', '3837. *', '804 That the legislative creation of this unfair labor practice was in no sense intended to cut the broad swath attributed to it by the Board in the present cases is pointed up by the further observation of Senator Taft \"This unfair labor practice referred to is not perhaps of tremendous importance, but employees cannot say to their employer, `we do not like Mr. X, we will not meet Mr. X. You have to send us Mr. Y.\\' That has been done.', 'It would prevent their saying to the employer, `You have to fire Foreman Jones.', 'We do not like Foreman Jones, and therefore you will have to fire him, or we will not go to work.\\' \"', '93 Cong.', 'Rec.', '3837. [', '15] Nowhere in the legislative history is there to be found any implication that Congress sought to extend protection to the employer from union restraint or coercion when engaged in any activity other than the selection of its representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining and grievance adjustment.', \"The conclusion is thus inescapable that a union's discipline of one of its members who is a supervisory employee can constitute a violation of § 8 (b) (1) (B) only when that discipline may *805 adversely affect the supervisor's conduct in performing the duties of, and acting in his capacity as, grievance adjuster or collective bargainer on behalf of the employer.\", \"We may assume without deciding that the Board's Oakland Mailers decision fell within the outer limits of this test, but its decisions in the present cases clearly do not.\", 'For it is certain that these supervisors were not engaged in collective bargaining or grievance adjustment, or in any activities related thereto, when they crossed union picket lines during an economic strike to engage in rank-and-file struck work. [', '16] It is strenuously asserted, however, that to permit a union to discipline supervisor-members for performing *806 rank-and-file work during an economic strike will deprive the employer of the full loyalty of those supervisors.', 'Indeed, it is precisely that concern that is reflected in these and other recent decisions of the Board holding that the statutory language \"restrain or coerce . . .', 'an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances\" is not confined to situations in which the union\\'s object is to force a change in the identity of the employer\\'s representatives, but may properly be read to encompass any situation in which the union\\'s actions are likely to deprive the employer of the undivided loyalty of his supervisory employees.', 'As the Board stated in Wisconsin Electric: \"During the strike of the Union, the Employer clearly considered its supervisors among those it could depend on during this period.', \"The Union's fining of the supervisors who were acting in the Employer's interest in performing the struck work severely jeopardized the relationship between the Employer and its supervisors.\", 'Thus, the fines, if found to be lawful, would now permit the Union to drive a wedge between a supervisor and the Employer, thus interfering with the performance of the duties the Employer had a right to expect the supervisor to perform.', 'The Employer could no longer count on the complete and undivided loyalty of those it had selected to act as its collective-bargaining agents or to act for it in adjusting grievances.', 'Moreover, such fines clearly interfere with the Employer\\'s control over its own representatives. \"', 'The purpose of Section 8 (b) (1) (B) is to assure to the employer that its selected collective-bargaining representatives will be completely faithful to its desires.', 'This cannot be achieved if the union has an *807 effective method, union disciplinary action, by which it can pressure such representatives to deviate from the interests of the employer.\"', '192 N. L. R. B., at 78.', 'The Board in the present cases echoes this view in arguing that \"where a supervisor is disciplined by the union for performing other supervisory or management functions, the likely effect of such discipline is to make him subservient to the union\\'s wishes when he performs those functions in the future.', 'Thus, even if the effect of this discipline did not carry over to the performance of the supervisor\\'s grievance adjustment or collective bargaining functions, the result would be to deprive the employer of the full allegiance of, and control over, a representative he has selected for grievance adjustment or collective bargaining purposes.\"', 'Brief for Petitioner in No.', '73-795, p. 34.', 'The concern expressed in this argument is a very real one, but the problem is one that Congress addressed, not through § 8 (b) (1) (B), but through a completely different legislative route.', 'Specifically, Congress in 1947 amended the definition of \"employee\" in § 2 (3), 29 U.S. C. § 152 (3), to exclude those denominated supervisors under § 2 (11), 29 U.S. C. § 152 (11), thereby excluding them from the coverage of the Act.

      "The Oregon Supreme Court denied review.\n",
      "Reese ultimately sought a federal writ of habeas corpus, raising, among other claims, a federal constitutional claim that his appellate counsel did not effectively represent him during one of his direct state-court appeals.\n",
      "The Federal District Court held that Reese had not \"fairly presented\" his federal \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim to the higher state courts because his brief in the state appeals court had not indicated that he was complaining about a violation of federal law.\n",
      "A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court.\n",
      "282 F. 3d 1184 (2002).\n",
      "Although the majority apparently believed that Reese's petition itself did not alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of the appellate \"ineffective assistance\" claim, it did not find that fact determinative.\n",
      "Id., at 1193-1194.\n",
      "Rather, it found that Reese had satisfied the \"fair presentation\" requirement because the justices of the Oregon Supreme Court had had \"the opportunity to read . . . the lower [Oregon] court decision claimed to be in error before deciding whether to grant discretionary review.\"\n",
      "Id., at 1194 (emphasis added).\n",

      "On that assumption, Reese failed *31 to meet the \"fair presentation\" standard, and the Ninth Circuit was wrong to hold the contrary.\n",
      "We recognize that the justices of the Oregon Supreme Court did have an \"opportunity\" to read the lower court opinions in Reese's case.\n",
      "That opportunity means that the judges could have read them.\n",
      "But to say that a petitioner \"fairly presents\" a federal claim when an appellate judge can discover that claim only by reading lower court opinions in the case is to say that those judges must read the lower court opinions  for otherwise they would forfeit the State's opportunity to decide that federal claim in the first instance.\n",
      "In our view, federal habeas corpus law does not impose such a requirement.\n",
      "For one thing, the requirement would force state appellate judges to alter their ordinary review practices.\n",
      "Appellate judges, of course, will often read lower court opinions, but they do not necessarily do so in every case.\n",
      "Sometimes an appellate court can decide a legal question on the basis of the briefs alone.\n",
      "That is particularly so where the question at issue is whether to exercise a discretionary power of review, i. e., whether to review the merits of a lower court decision.\n",
      "In such instances, the nature of the issue may matter more than does the legal validity of the lower court decision.\n",
      "And the nature of the issue alone may lead the court to decide not to hear the case.\n",
      "Indeed, the Oregon Supreme Court is a court with a discretionary power of review.\n",
      "And Oregon Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.05(7) (2003) instructs litigants seeking discretionary review to identify clearly in the petition itself the legal questions presented, why those questions have special importance, a short statement of relevant facts, and the reasons for reversal, \"including appropriate authorities.\"\n",
      "For another thing, the opinion-reading requirement would impose a serious burden upon judges of state appellate courts, particularly those with discretionary review powers.\n",
      "Those courts have heavy workloads, which would be significantly *32 increased if their judges had to read through lower court opinions or briefs in every instance.\n",
      "See National Center for State Courts, State Court Caseload Statistics 2002, pp.\n",
      "106-110 (Table 2) Finally, we do not find such a requirement necessary to avoid imposing unreasonable procedural burdens upon state prisoners who may eventually seek habeas corpus.\n",
      "A litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief, for example, by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim \"federal.\"\n",
      "For these reasons, we believe that the requirement imposed by the Ninth Circuit would unjustifiably undercut the considerations of federal-state comity that the exhaustion requirement seeks to promote.\n",
      "We consequently hold that ordinarily a state prisoner does not \"fairly present\" a claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition or a brief (or a similar document) that does not alert it to the presence of a federal claim in order to find material, such as a lower court opinion in the case, that does so.\n",
      "Reese argues in the alternative that it is wrong to assume that his petition by itself failed to alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of his \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim.\n",
      "We do not agree.\n",
      "Reese must concede that his petition does not explicitly say that the words \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" refer to a federal claim.\n",
      "The petition refers to provisions of the Federal Constitution in respect to other claims but not in respect to this one.\n",
      "The petition provides no citation of any case that might have alerted the court to the alleged federal nature of the claim.\n",
      "And the petition does not even contain a factual description supporting the claim.\n",
      "Cf. Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152 , 163 (1996); Duncan, 513 U. S., at 366 .\n",
      "Reese asserts that the petition nonetheless \"fairly presents\" a federal \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim for two reasons.\n",
      "First, he says that the word \"ineffective\" is a term of art in Oregon that refers only to federal-law claims and not to similar state-law claims, which, he adds, in Oregon are solely referred to as \"inadequate assistance\" claims.\n",
      "And thus the Oregon Supreme Court should have known, from his use of the word \"ineffective,\" that his claim was federal.\n",
      "Reese, however, has not demonstrated that Oregon law uses the words \"ineffective assistance\" in the manner he suggests, that is, as referring only to a federal-law claim.\n",
      "See, e. g., Lichau v. Baldwin, 166 Ore. App. 411, 415, 417, 999 P. 2d 1207 , 1210, 1211 (2000) (using \"ineffective assistance\" to refer to violations of the Oregon Constitution) ev'd in part, 333 Ore. 350 , 39 P. 3d 851 (2002).\n",
      "Indeed, Reese's own petition uses both phrases  \"ineffective assistance\" and \"inadequate assistance\"  at different points to refer to what is apparently a single claim.\n",
      "Second, Reese says that in Oregon the standards for adjudicating state and federal \"inadequate/ineffective appellate assistance\" claims are identical.\n",
      "He adds that, where that identity exists, a petitioner need not indicate a claim's federal nature, because, by raising a state-law claim, he would necessarily \"fairly present\" the corresponding federal claim.\n",
      "*34\n",
      "However, the Ninth Circuit did not address this argument, and our reading of the briefs filed in the Ninth Circuit leads us to conclude that Reese did not there seek consideration of the argument in that court.\n",
      "Indeed, the argument first made its appearance in this Court in Reese's brief on the merits.\n",
      "Under this Court's Rule 15.2, \"a nonjurisdictional argument not raised in a respondent's brief in opposition to a petition for a writ of certiorari may be deemed waived.\"\n",
      "Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61 , 75, n. 13 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n",
      "This argument falls squarely within the rule.\n",
      "The complex nature of Reese's claim and its broad implications suggest that its consideration by the lower courts would help in its resolution.\n",
      "Hence, without expressing any view on the merits of the issue, we exercise our Rule 15.2 discretion and deem the argument waived in this Court.\n",
      "See, e. g., Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U. S. 249 , 253-254 (1999) (per curiam); South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U. S. 160 , 171 (1999); cf.\n",

opinions in Reese\\'s case.', 'That opportunity means that the judges could have read them.', 'But to say that a petitioner \"fairly presents\" a federal claim when an appellate judge can discover that claim only by reading lower court opinions in the case is to say that those judges must read the lower court opinions \\x97 for otherwise they would forfeit the State\\'s opportunity to decide that federal claim in the first instance.', 'In our view, federal habeas corpus law does not impose such a requirement.', 'For one thing, the requirement would force state appellate judges to alter their ordinary review practices.', 'Appellate judges, of course, will often read lower court opinions, but they do not necessarily do so in every case.', 'Sometimes an appellate court can decide a legal question on the basis of the briefs alone.', 'That is particularly so where the question at issue is whether to exercise a discretionary power of review, i. e., whether to review the merits of a lower court decision.', 'In such instances, the nature of the issue may matter more than does the legal validity of the lower court decision.', 'And the nature of the issue alone may lead the court to decide not to hear the case.', 'Indeed, the Oregon Supreme Court is a court with a discretionary power of review.', 'And Oregon Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.05(7) (2003) instructs litigants seeking discretionary review to identify clearly in the petition itself the legal questions presented, why those questions have special importance, a short statement of relevant facts, and the reasons for reversal, \"including appropriate authorities.\"', 'For another thing, the opinion-reading requirement would impose a serious burden upon judges of state appellate courts, particularly those with discretionary review powers.', 'Those courts have heavy workloads, which would be significantly *32 increased if their judges had to read through lower court opinions or briefs in every instance.', 'See National Center for State Courts, State Court Caseload Statistics 2002, pp.', '106-110 (Table 2) Finally, we do not find such a requirement necessary to avoid imposing unreasonable procedural burdens upon state prisoners who may eventually seek habeas corpus.', 'A litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief, for example, by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim \"federal.\"', 'For these reasons, we believe that the requirement imposed by the Ninth Circuit would unjustifiably undercut the considerations of federal-state comity that the exhaustion requirement seeks to promote.', 'We consequently hold that ordinarily a state prisoner does not \"fairly present\" a claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition or a brief (or a similar document) that does not alert it to the presence of a federal claim in order to find material, such as a lower court opinion in the case, that does so.', 'Reese argues in the alternative that it is wrong to assume that his petition by itself failed to alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of his \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim.', 'We do not agree.', 'Reese must concede that his petition does not explicitly say that the words \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" refer to a federal claim.', 'The petition refers to provisions of the Federal Constitution in respect to other claims but not in respect to this one.', 'The petition provides no citation of any case that might have alerted the court to the alleged federal nature of the claim.', 'And the petition does not even contain a factual description supporting the claim.', 'Cf. Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152 , 163 (1996); Duncan, 513 U. S., at 366 .', 'Reese asserts that the petition nonetheless \"fairly presents\" a federal \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim for two reasons.', 'First, he says that the word \"ineffective\" is a term of art in Oregon that refers only to federal-law claims and not to similar state-law claims, which, he adds, in Oregon are solely referred to as \"inadequate assistance\" claims.', 'And thus the Oregon Supreme Court should have known, from his use of the word \"ineffective,\" that his claim was federal.', 'Reese, however, has not demonstrated that Oregon law uses the words \"ineffective assistance\" in the manner he suggests, that is, as referring only to a federal-law claim.', 'See, e. g., Lichau v. Baldwin, 166 Ore. App. 411, 415, 417, 999 P. 2d 1207 , 1210, 1211 (2000) (using \"ineffective assistance\" to refer to violations of the Oregon Constitution) ev\\'d in part, 333 Ore. 350 , 39 P. 3d 851 (2002).', 'Indeed, Reese\\'s own petition uses both phrases \\x97 \"ineffective assistance\" and \"inadequate assistance\" \\x97 at different points to refer to what is apparently a single claim.', 'Second, Reese says that in Oregon the standards for adjudicating state and federal \"inadequate/ineffective appellate assistance\" claims are identical.', 'He adds that, where that identity exists, a petitioner need not indicate a claim\\'s federal nature, because, by raising a state-law claim, he would necessarily \"fairly present\" the corresponding federal claim.', '*34', 'However, the Ninth Circuit did not address this argument, and our reading of the briefs filed in the Ninth Circuit leads us to conclude that Reese did not there seek consideration of the argument in that court.', \"Indeed, the argument first made its appearance in this Court in Reese's brief on the merits.\", 'Under this Court\\'s Rule 15.2, \"a nonjurisdictional argument not raised in a respondent\\'s brief in opposition to a petition for a writ of certiorari may be deemed waived.\"', 'Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61 , 75, n. 13 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'This argument falls squarely within the rule.', \"The complex nature of Reese's claim and its broad implications suggest that its consideration by the lower courts would help in its resolution.\", 'Hence, without expressing any view on the merits of the issue, we exercise our Rule 15.2 discretion and deem the argument waived in this Court.', 'See, e. g., Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U. S. 249 , 253-254 (1999) (per curiam); South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U. S. 160 , 171 (1999); cf.', 'Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U.

      "The issue here is whether the Fourth Amendment prohibits the warrantless search and seizure of garbage left for collection outside the curtilage of a home.\n",
      "We conclude, in accordance with the vast majority of lower courts that have addressed the issue, that it does not.\n",
      "In early 1984, Investigator Jenny Stracner of the Laguna Beach Police Department received information indicating that respondent Greenwood might be engaged in narcotics trafficking.\n",
      "Stracner learned that a criminal suspect had informed a federal drug enforcement agent in February 1984 that a truck filled with illegal drugs was en route to the Laguna Beach address at which Greenwood resided.\n",
      "In addition, a neighbor complained of heavy vehicular traffic late at night in front of Greenwood's single-family home.\n",
      "The neighbor reported that the vehicles remained at Greenwood's house for only a few minutes.\n",
      "Stracner sought to investigate this information by conducting a surveillance of Greenwood's home.\n",
      "She observed several vehicles make brief stops at the house during the late-night and early morning hours, and she followed a truck from the house to a residence that had previously been under investigation as a narcotics-trafficking location.\n",
      "On April 6, 1984, Stracner asked the neighborhood's regular trash collector to pick up the plastic garbage bags that Greenwood had left on the curb in front of his house and to turn the bags over to her without mixing their contents with garbage from other houses.\n",
      "The trash collector cleaned his truck bin of other refuse, collected the garbage bags from the street in front of Greenwood's house, and turned the bags over to Stracner.\n",
      "The officer searched through the rubbish *38 and found items indicative of narcotics use.\n",
      "She recited the information that she had gleaned from the trash search in an affidavit in support of a warrant to search Greenwood's home.\n",
      "Police officers encountered both respondents at the house later that day when they arrived to execute the warrant.\n",
      "The police discovered quantities of cocaine and hashish during their search of the house.\n",
      "Respondents were arrested on felony narcotics charges.\n",
      "They subsequently posted bail.\n",
      "The police continued to receive reports of many late-night visitors to the Greenwood house.\n",
      "On May 4, Investigator Robert Rahaeuser obtained Greenwood's garbage from the regular trash collector in the same manner as had Stracner.\n",
      "The garbage again contained evidence of narcotics use.\n",
      "Rahaeuser secured another search warrant for Greenwood's home based on the information from the second trash search.\n",
      "The police found more narcotics and evidence of narcotics trafficking when they executed the warrant.\n",
      "Greenwood was again arrested.\n",
      "The Superior Court dismissed the charges against respondents on the authority of People v. Krivda, 5 Cal.\n",
      "3d 357 , 486 P.2d 1262 (1971), which held that warrantless trash searches violate the Fourth Amendment and the California Constitution.\n",

      "They assert, however, that they had, and exhibited, an expectation of privacy with respect to the trash that was searched by the police: The trash, which was placed on the street for collection at a fixed time, was contained in opaque plastic bags, which the garbage collector was expected to pick up, mingle with the trash of others, and deposit at the garbage dump.\n",
      "The trash was only temporarily on the street, and there was little likelihood that it would be inspected by anyone.\n",
      "It may well be that respondents did not expect that the contents of their garbage bags would become known to the police or other members of the public.\n",
      "An expectation of privacy does not give rise to Fourth Amendment protection, *40 however, unless society is prepared to accept that expectation as objectively reasonable.\n",
      "Here, we conclude that respondents exposed their garbage to the public sufficiently to defeat their claim to Fourth Amendment protection.\n",
      "It is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals, [2] children, scavengers, [3] snoops, [4] and other members of the public.\n",
      "See Krivda, supra , at 367, 486 P.2d, at 1269 .\n",
      "Moreover, respondents placed their refuse at the curb for the express purpose of conveying it to a third party, the trash collector, who might himself have sorted through respondents' trash or permitted others, such as the police, to do so.\n",

Reicherter, 647 F.2d 397 , 399 (CA3 1981), respondents could have had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the inculpatory items that they discarded.\n",
      "Furthermore, as we have held, the police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by any member of the public.\n",
      "Hence, \"[w]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\"\n",

      "We held in Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), for example, that the police did not violate the Fourth Amendment by causing a pen register to be installed at the telephone company's offices to record the telephone numbers dialed by a criminal suspect.\n",
      "An individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in the numbers dialed on his telephone, we reasoned, because he voluntarily conveys those numbers to the telephone company when he uses the telephone.\n",

      "Similarly, we held in California v. Ciraolo, supra , that the police were not required by the Fourth Amendment to obtain a warrant before conducting surveillance of the respondent's fenced backyard from a private plane flying at an altitude of 1,000 feet.\n",

Reicherter, 647 F.2d 397 , 399 (CA3 1981), respondents could have had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the inculpatory items that they discarded.', 'Furthermore, as we have held, the police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by any member of the public.', 'Hence, \"[w]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\"', 'Katz v. United States, supra, at 351.', \"We held in Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), for example, that the police did not violate the Fourth Amendment by causing a pen register to be installed at the telephone company's offices to record the telephone numbers dialed by a criminal suspect.\", 'An individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in the numbers dialed on his telephone, we reasoned, because he voluntarily conveys those numbers to the telephone company when he uses the telephone.', 'Again, we observed that \"a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties.\"', 'Id., at 743-744.', \"Similarly, we held in California v. Ciraolo, supra , that the police were not required by the Fourth Amendment to obtain a warrant before conducting surveillance of the respondent's fenced backyard from a private plane flying at an altitude of 1,000 feet.\", 'We concluded that the respondent\\'s expectation that his yard was protected from such surveillance was unreasonable because \"[a]ny member of the public flying in this airspace who glanced down could have seen everything that these officers observed.\"', 'Id., at 213-214.', \"Our conclusion that society would not accept as reasonable respondents' claim to an expectation of privacy in trash left for collection in an area accessible to the public is reinforced by the unanimous rejection of similar claims by the Federal Courts of Appeals.\", 'See United States v.

      "These cases involve 42 U.S. C .\n",
      "§262(l), which was en- acted as part of the Biologics Price Competition and Inno- vation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), 124 Stat. 808.\n",
      "The BPCIA governs a type of drug called a biosimilar, which is a biologic product that is highly similar to a biologic product that has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n",
      "Under §262(l), an applicant that seeks FDA approval of a biosimilar must provide its appli- cation materials and manufacturing information to the manufacturer of the corresponding biologic within 20 days of the date the FDA notifies the applicant that it has accepted the application for review.\n",
      "The applicant then must give notice to the manufacturer at least 180 days before marketing the biosimilar commercially.\n",
      "The first question presented by these cases is whether the requirement that an applicant provide its application and manufacturing information to the manufacturer of the biologic is enforceable by injunction.\n",
      "We conclude that an injunction is not available under federal law, but we re- mand for the court below to decide whether an injunction is available under state law.\n",
      "The second question is whether the applicant must give notice to the manufac- turer after, rather than before, obtaining a license from the FDA for its biosimilar.\n",
      "We conclude that an applicant may provide notice before obtaining a license.\n",
      "We conclude that an applicant may provide notice before obtaining a license.\n",
      "The complex statutory scheme at issue in these cases establishes processes both for obtaining FDA approval of biosimilars and for resolving patent disputes between manufacturers of licensed biologics and manufacturers of biosimilars.\n",
      "Before turning to the questions presented, we first explain the statutory background.\n",
      "A biologic is a type of drug derived from natural, biologi- cal sources such as animals or microorganisms.\n",
      "iologics thus differ from traditional drugs, which are typically synthesized from chemicals.1 A manufacturer of a biologic may market the drug only if the FDA has licensed it pur- suant to either of two review processes set forth in §262.\n",
      "The default pathway for approval, used for new biologics, is set forth in §262(a).\n",
      "Under that subsection, the FDA may license a new biologic if, among other things, the manufacturer demonstrates that it is “safe, pure, and potent.”\n",
      "§262(a)(2)(C)(i)(I).\n",
      "In addition to this default route, the statute also prescribes an alternative, abbrevi- ated route for FDA approval of biosimilars, which is set forth in §262(k).\n",
      "To obtain approval through the BPCIA’s abbreviated process, the manufacturer of a biosimilar (applicant) does not need to show that the product is “safe, pure, and po- tent.”\n",
      "Instead, the applicant may piggyback on the show- ing made by the manufacturer (sponsor) of a previously licensed biologic (reference product).\n",
      "See §262(k)(2)(A)(iii).\n",
      "An applicant must show that its product is “highly simi- lar” to the reference product and that there are no “clini- cally meaningful differences” between the two in terms of “safety, purity, and potency.”\n",
      "§§262(i)(2)(A), (B) see also §262(k)(2)(A)(i)(I).\n",
      "An applicant may not submit an appli- cation until 4 years after the reference product is first licensed, and the FDA may not license a biosimilar until 12 years after the reference product is first licensed.\n",
      "§§262(k)(7)(A), (B).\n",
      "As a result, the manufacturer of a new biologic enjoys a 12-year period when its biologic may be marketed without competition from biosimilars.\n",
      "A sponsor may hold multiple patents covering the bio- logic, its therapeutic uses, and the processes used to man- ufacture it.\n",
      "Those patents may constrain an applicant’s ability to market its biosimilar even after the expiration of the 12-year exclusivity period contained in §262(k)(7)(A).\n",
      "The BPCIA facilitates litigation during the period pre- ceding FDA approval so that the parties do not have to wait until commercial marketing to resolve their patent disputes.\n",
      "It enables the parties to bring infringement actions at certain points in the application process, even if the applicant has not yet committed an act that would traditionally constitute patent infringement.\n",

      "The jury that found appellant guilty was instructed on obscenity pursuant to the Georgia statute, which defines obscene material in language similar to that of the definition of obscenity set forth in this Court's plurality opinion in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413 , 418 (1966): \"Material is obscene if considered as a whole, applying community standards, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid *155 interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and utterly without redeeming social value and if, in addition, it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in describing or representing such matters.\"\n",

      "We conclude here that the film \"Carnal Knowledge\" is not obscene under the constitutional standards announced in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), and that the First and Fourteenth Amendments therefore require that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia affirming appellant's conviction be reversed.\n",
      "Appellant was the manager of the theater in which \"Carnal Knowledge\" was being shown.\n",

      "Appellant was fined $750 and sentenced to 12 months' probation.\n",
      "He appealed to the Supreme Court of Georgia, which by a divided vote affirmed the judgment of conviction on July 2, 1973.\n",
      "That court stated that the definition of obscenity contained in the Georgia statute was \"considerably more restrictive\" than the new test set forth in the recent case of Miller v. California, supra , and that the First Amendment does not protect the commercial exhibition of \"hard core\" pornography.\n",
      "The dissenting Justices, in addition to other disagreements with the court, thought that \"Carnal Knowledge\" was entitled to the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n",
      "Appellant then appealed *157 to this Court and we noted probable jurisdiction, 414 U.S. 1090 (1973).\n",
      "We agree with the Supreme Court of Georgia's implicit ruling that the Constitution does not require that juries be instructed in state obscenity cases to apply the standards of a hypothetical statewide community.\n",
      "Miller approved the use of such instructions; it did not mandate their use.\n",
      "What Miller makes clear is that state juries need not be instructed to apply \"national standards.\"\n",
      "We also agree with the Supreme Court of Georgia's implicit approval of the trial court's instructions directing jurors to apply \"community standards\" without specifying what \"community.\"\n",
      "Miller held that it was constitutionally permissible to permit juries to rely on the understanding of the community from which they came as to contemporary community standards, and the States have considerable latitude in framing statutes under this element of the Miller decision.\n",
      "A State may choose to define an obscenity offense in terms of \"contemporary community standards\" as defined in Miller without further specification, as was done here, or it may choose to define the standards in more precise geographic terms, as was done by California in Miller.\n",
      "We now turn to the question of whether appellant's exhibition of the film was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, a question which appellee asserts is not properly before us because appellant did not raise it on his state appeal.\n",

      "We also note that the trial court instructed the jury on charges other than the distribution charge. [4]\n",

      "The film appeared on many \"Ten Best\" lists for 1971, the year in which it was released.\n",
      "Many but not all of the reviews were favorable.\n",
      "We believe that the following passage from a review which appeared in the Saturday Review is a reasonably accurate description of the film: \"[It is basically a story] of two young college men, roommates and lifelong friends forever preoccupied with their sex lives.\n",
      "Both are first met as virgins.\n",
      "Nicholson is the more knowledgeable and attractive of the two; speaking colloquially, he is a burgeoning bastard.\n",

      "As the `safer' one of the two, he is selected by Susan for marriage.\n",
      "\"The time changes.\n",
      "Both men are in their thirties, pursuing successful careers in New York.\n",
      "Nicholson has been running through an average of a dozen women a year but has never managed to meet the right one, the one with the full bosom, the good legs, *159 the properly rounded bottom.\n",
      "More than that, each and every one is a threat to his malehood and peace of mind, until at last, in a bar, he finds Ann-Margret, an aging bachelor girl with striking cleavage and, quite obviously, something of a past.\n",
      "`Why don't we shack up?'\n",
      "she suggests.\n",
      "They do and a horrendous relationship ensues, complicated mainly by her paranoidal desire to marry.\n",
      "Meanwhile, what of Garfunkel?\n",
      "The sparks have gone out of his marriage, the sex has lost its savor, and Garfunkel tries once more.\n",
      "And later, even more foolishly, again.\" [6]\n",
      "Appellee contends essentially that under Miller the obscenity vel non of the film \"Carnal Knowledge\" was a question for the jury, and that the jury having resolved the question against appellant, and there being some evidence to support its findings, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed.\n",
      "We turn to the language of Miller to evaluate appellee's contention.\n",
      "Miller states that the questions of what appeals to the \"prurient interest\" and what is \"patently offensive\" under the obscenity test which it formulates are \"essentially questions of fact.\"\n",
      "413 U.S., at 30 .\n",
      "\"When triers of fact are asked to decide whether `the average person, applying contemporary community standards' would consider certain materials `prurient' it would be unrealistic to require that the answer be based on some abstract formulation. . . .\n",
      "To require a State to structure obscenity proceedings around evidence of a national `community standard' would be an exercise in futility.\"\n",
      "Ibid.\n",
      "We held in Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49 (1973), decided on the same day, that expert testimony *160 as to obscenity is not necessary when the films at issue are themselves placed in evidence.\n",
      "Id., at 56.\n",
      "But all of this does not lead us to agree with the Supreme Court of Georgia's apparent conclusion that the jury's verdict against appellant virtually precluded all further appellate review of appellant's assertion that his exhibition of the film was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n",
      "Even though questions of appeal to the \"prurient interest\" or of patent offensiveness are \"essentially questions of fact,\" it would be a serious misreading of Miller to conclude that juries have unbridled discretion in determining what is \"patently offensive.\"\n",
      "Not only did we there say that \"the First Amendment values applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment are adequately protected by the ultimate power of appellate courts to conduct an independent review of constitutional claims when necessary,\" 413 U.S., at 25, but we made it plain that under that holding \"no one will be subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene materials unless these materials depict or describe patently offensive `hard core' sexual conduct . . . .\"\n",
      "Id., at 27.\n",
      "We also took pains in Miller to \"give a few plain examples of what a state statute could define for regulation under part (b) of the standard announced,\" that is, the requirement of patent offensiveness.\n",
      "Id., at 25.\n",

      "In February 1981, sole custody was granted to Richard by the California court, subject to reasonable visitation rights for Judith.\n",

      "The 1916 Act divided the United States into 12 regional districts under the general supervision of a Federal Farm Loan Board.\n",
      "Each district contained a federal land bank designed to loan money to farmers at low interest rates.\n",

      "The legislative history and the language of the Act itself indicate that Congress faced somewhat of a dilemma in structuring the land bank system.\n",
      "On the one hand, there was a strong congressional desire to stimulate a privately controlled, privately owned, and privately financed program based upon the cooperative efforts of dedicated farmers.\n",

      "When the surplus account reaches 25% of the total outstanding capital stock of the Bank, the excess may be distributed to members in the form of Class C stock.\n",
      "Only the tax treatment of the quarterly purchases is disputed here. [11]\n",
      "The taxpayers correctly note that the Class C stock has attributes which would make a normal commercial stock undesirable.\n",
      "For example, the C stock pays no dividends; [12] it is transferable *308 only between cooperatives and only under rare circumstances; additional shares do not provide additional voting power; [13] and the stock cannot be redeemed until all A, all B issued earlier or in the same year, and all earlier issued C shares have been called for redemption.\n",
      "These characteristics render the market for C shares virtually nonexistent.\n",
      "It must be remembered, however, that the stock was intentionally given these characteristics by a Congress with definite goals in mind. [14]\n",
      "The legislative history of the Farm Credit Act of 1955 indicates that Congress placed much of the blame for the Bank's inability to *309 repay the capital extended by the Government and to retain private capital on the provision in the 1933 legislation which permitted borrowers to redeem their stock for cash upon paying off their loans.\n",
      "The restrictions on redemption and transferability and the dividend prohibition were designed to obviate this difficulty and to provide both a stable membership and permanent capital, two necessities for the success of any cooperative venture.\n",
      "The taxpayers do not seek to deduct the cost of their initial shares in the Bank as interest.\n",
      "They accept the fact that these shares represent one cost of membership and that this cost is a capital expense because membership is a valuable asset in more than one taxable year.\n",
      "But, they argue that once they purchased their initial shares, they obtained full membership rights, and, a fortiori, that Congress must have intended the quarterly expenditures for stock to be a charge for borrowing money since the stock has no value.\n",
      "The fact is, however, that the stock purchased quarterly is indeed valuable.\n",
      "The amounts paid for C shares become part of the permanent capital structure of the Bank, thereby increasing the stability of the Bank and insuring its continued ability to extend credit.\n",
      "Each share also provides an opportunity for more patronage and surplus dividends, an ultimate right of redemption, and an asset that may be used as a set-off in case of a default on the loan.\n",
      "In sum, every share of stock purchased quarterly by the taxpayers is nearly as valuable as the shares purchased initially.\n",
      "It is therefore difficult to understand why these different purchases should receive radically different tax treatment.\n",
      "If Congress had required 1,000 or 100,000 shares of Class C stock to be purchased *310 before an association could borrow from the Banks, under the taxpayers' theory of the case the cost of those shares would be a nondeductible capital expense.\n",
      "Simply because Congress eased the burden on farmers by spreading the requirement of capital investment over a period of time rather than requiring it as a prerequisite to borrowing, the taxpayers are entitled to no more favorable tax treatment.\n",
      "It is important not to lose sight of the congressional purposes in enacting the farm credit legislation.\n",
      "The immediate goal was to provide loans to farmers at low interest rates.\n",
      "It would, therefore, be odd for Congress to provide a \"hidden\" interest charge in the legislation.\n",
      "The long-range goal was to make the Banks \"fully cooperative and to place full ownership and responsibility for their operations and success in the hands of those eligible to borrow from them.\"\n",
      "Hearings on Farm Credit Act of 1955 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 60.\n",
      "Congress felt, in light of its experience under the Farm Credit Act of 1933, that the long-range goal could only be achieved if Bank members made longterm investments in the Banks.\n",
      "Hence, Congress created Class C stock, a security with a special value in cooperative ventures.\n",
      "While this security is sui generis, the congressional scheme makes it clear that it has value over the long run.\n",
      "Since the security is of value in more than one taxable year, it is a capital asset within the meaning of § 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code, and its cost is nondeductible.\n",
      "Cf. Commissioner v. Lincoln Savings & Loan Assn., 403 U.S. 345 (1971); Old Colony R. Co. v. United States, 284 U.S. 552 (1932); 26 CFR § 1.461-1.\n",
      "We reject the contention that while the Class C *311 stock may be a capital asset, it is worth only $1, [15] and that the additional $99 paid for each share must represent interest.\n",
      "Were we dealing with the traditional corporate structure in this case, the taxpayers' argument would have strength.\n",
      "But, as we have pointed out previously, the essential nature of cooperatives and corporations differs.\n",
      "The value of the Class C stock derives primarily from attributes other than marketability.\n",
      "The stock has value because it is the foundation of the cooperative scheme; it insures stability and continuity.\n",
      "The stock also has value because it enables the farmers to work together toward common goals.\n",
      "It enables them to share in a venture of common concerns and to reap the rewards of knowing that they can finance themselves without the assistance of the Federal Government.\n",
      "It is perhaps debatable whether these attributes should properly be valued at $100 per share, but we are not called upon merely to resolve a question of valuation.\n",
      "Rather, we must decide whether it is artificial to characterize these unique expenditures as payments for a capital asset.\n",
      "We find that it is not.\n",

      "This theory of recovery was open to respondent under New Hampshire law; the trial judge explicitly instructed the jury that \"an imputation of impropriety or a crime to one or some of a small group that casts suspicion upon all is actionable.\" [3]\n",
      "The question is presented, however, whether that theory of recovery is precluded by our holding in New York Times that, in the absence of sufficient evidence that the attack focused on the plaintiff, an otherwise impersonal attack on governmental operations cannot be utilized to establish a libel of those administering the operations.\n",
      "376 U. S., at 290-292 .\n",
      "The plaintiff in New York Times was one of the three elected Commissioners of the City of Montgomery, Alabama.\n",
      "His duties included the supervision of the police department.\n",
      "The statements in the advertisement upon which he principally relied as referring to him were that \"truckloads of police . . . ringed the Alabama State College Campus\" after a demonstration on the State Capitol steps, and that Dr. Martin Luther King had been \"arrested . . . seven times.\"\n",
      "These statements were false in that although the police had been \"deployed near the campus,\" they had not actually \"ringed\" it and had not gone there in connection with a State Capitol demonstration, and in that Dr. King had been arrested only *81 four times.\n",
      "We held that evidence that Sullivan as Police Commissioner was the supervisory head of the Police Department was constitutionally insufficient to show that the statements about police activity were \"of and concerning\" him; we rejected as inconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments the proposition followed by the Alabama Supreme Court in the case that \"[i]n measuring the performance or deficiencies of . . .\n",

      "These situations are distinguishable from the present case; here, the jury was permitted to infer both defamatory content and reference from the challenged statement itself, although the statement on its face is only an impersonal discussion of government activity.\n",
      "To the extent the trial judge authorized the jury to award respondent a recovery without regard to evidence that the asserted implication of the column was made specifically of and concerning him, we hold that the instruction was erroneous. [6]\n",
      "Here, no explicit charge of peculation was made; no assault on the previous management appears.\n",
      "The jury was permitted to award damages upon a finding merely that respondent was one of a small group acting for an organ of government, only some of whom were implicated, but all of whom were tinged with suspicion.\n",
      "In effect, this permitted the jury to find liability merely on the basis of his relationship to the government agency, the operations of which were the subject of discussion.\n",
      "It is plain that the elected Commissioners, also members of that group, *83 would have been barred from suit on this theory under New York Times.\n",
      "They would be required to show specific reference.\n",

      "A theory that the column cast indiscriminate suspicion on the members of the group responsible for the conduct of this governmental operation is tantamount to a demand for recovery based on libel of government, and therefore is constitutionally insufficient.\n",
      "Since the trial judge's instructions were erroneous in this respect, the judgment must be reversed.\n",
      "Respondent's second theory, supported by testimony of several witnesses, was that the column was read as referring specifically to him, as the \"man in charge\" at the Area, personally responsible for its financial affairs.\n",
      "Even accepting respondent's reading, the column manifestly discusses the conduct of operations of government. [8]\n",
      "The subject matter may have been only of local interest, but at least here, where publication was addressed primarily to the interested community, that fact is constitutionally irrelevant.\n",
      "The question is squarely presented whether the \"public official\" designation under New York Times applies.\n",
      "If it does, it is clear that the jury instructions were improper.\n",
      "Under the instructions, the jury was permitted *84 to find that negligent misstatement of fact would defeat petitioner's privilege.\n",
      "That test was rejected in Garrison, 379 U. S., at 79 , where we said, \"The test which we laid down in New York Times is not keyed to ordinary care; defeasance of the privilege is conditioned, not on mere negligence, but on reckless disregard for the truth.\"\n",
      "The trial court also charged that \"[d]efamatory matter which constitutes comment rather than fact is justified if made without malice and represented fair comment on matters of public interest,\" and defined malice to include \"ill will, evil motive, intention to injure . . . .\"\n",
      "This definition of malice is constitutionally insufficient where discussion of public affairs is concerned; \"[w]e held in New York Times that a public official might be allowed the civil remedy only if he establishes that the utterance was false and that it was made with knowledge of its falsity or in reckless disregard of whether it was false or true.\"\n",

      "Section 8 (b) (1) (B) of the National Labor Relations Act, 61 Stat. 141, 29 U.S. C. § 158 (b) (1) (B), makes it an unfair labor practice for a union \"to restrain or coerce . . .\n",
      "an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.\"\n",
      "The respondent unions in these consolidated cases called economic strikes against the employer companies.\n",
      "During the strikes, supervisory employees of the companies, some of whom were members of bargaining units and some of whom were not, but all of whom were union members, crossed *792 the picket lines and performed rank-and-file struck work, i. e., work normally performed by the nonsupervisory employees then on strike.\n",
      "The unions later disciplined these supervisors for so doing.\n",
      "The question to be decided is whether the unions committed unfair labor practices under § 8 (b) (1) (B) when they disciplined their supervisor-members for crossing the picket lines and performing rank-and-file struck work during lawful economic strikes against the companies.\n",
      "Since 1909, Local 134, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO, one of the respondents in No. 73-795, has been recognized by the Illinois Bell Telephone Co. (Illinois Bell) and its predecessors as the exclusive bargaining representative for both rank-and-file and certain supervisory personnel, including general foremen, P. B. X. installation foremen, and building cable foremen.\n",
      "Rather than exercise its right to refuse to hire union members as supervisors, the company agreed to the inclusion of a union security clause in the collective-bargaining agreement which required that these supervisors, like the rank-and-file employees, maintain membership in Local 134.\n",
      "In addition, the bargaining agreement in effect at the time of this dispute contained provisions for the conditions of employment and certain wages of these foremen.\n",
      "Other higher ranking supervisors, however, were neither represented by the union for collective-bargaining purposes nor covered by the agreement, although they were permitted to maintain their union membership. [1]\n",
      "793 By virtue of that membership\n",
      ", these supervisors, like those within the bargaining units, received substantial benefits, including participation in the International's pension and death-benefit plans and in group life insurance and old-age-benefit plans sponsored by Local 134.\n",
      "Under the International's constitution, all union members could be penalized for committing any of 23 enumerated offenses, including \"[w]orking in the interest of any organization or cause which is detrimental to, or opposed to, the I. B. E. W.,\" App. 76, and \"[w]orking for any individual or company declared in difficulty with a [local union] or the I. B. E. W.\" Id., at 77.\n",
      "Between May 8, 1968, and September 20, 1968, Local 134 engaged in an economic strike against the company.\n",
      "At the inception of the strike, Illinois Bell informed its supervisory personnel that it would like to have them come to work during the stoppage but that the decision whether or not to do so would be left to each individual, and that those who chose not to work would not be penalized.\n",
      "Local 134, on the other hand, warned its supervisor-members that they would be subject to disciplinary action if they performed rank-and-file work during the strike.\n",
      "Some of the supervisor-members crossed the union picket lines to perform rank-and-file struck work.\n",
      "Local 134 thereupon initiated disciplinary proceedings against these supervisors, and those found guilty were *794 fined $500 each. [2]\n",
      "Charges were then filed with the NLRB by the Bell Supervisors Protective Association, an association formed by five supervisors to obtain counsel for and otherwise protect the supervisors who worked during the strike.\n",
      "The Board, one member dissenting, held that in thus disciplining the supervisory personnel, the union had violated § 8 (b) (1) (B) of the Act, [3] in accord with its decision of the same day in Local 2150, IBEW (Wisconsin Electric Power Co.), 192 N.

      "192 N. L. R. B., at 78.\n",
      "Accordingly, the Board ordered the unions to rescind the fines, to expunge all records thereof, and to reimburse the supervisors for any portions of the fines paid.\n",
      "The Florida Power & Light Co. (Florida Power), the petitioner in No. 73-556, has maintained a collective-bargaining agreement with the International *795 Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO and Locals 641, 622, 759, 820, and 1263, represented by the System Council U-4, [4] since 1953.\n",
      "That agreement does not require employees to become union members as a condition of employment, but many of its supervisory personnel have in fact joined the union.\n",
      "The company has elected to recognize the union as the exclusive bargaining representative of these supervisors, and certain aspects of their wages and conditions of employment are provided for in the agreement. [5]\n",
      "In addition, other higher supervisory personnel not covered by the agreement were allowed to maintain union membership, [6] and, although not represented by the union for collective-bargaining purposes, received substantial benefits as a result of their union membership, including pension, disability, and death benefits under the terms of the International's constitution.\n",
      "Since the same International union was involved in both No. 73-556 and No. 73-795, the union members of Florida Power bore the same obligations under the International's constitution as did the union members of Illinois Bell.\n",
      "See supra, at 793.\n",
      "With respect to union discipline of supervisor members, however, the Florida Power collective-bargaining agreement itself provided: \"It is further agreed that employees in [supervisory] classifications have definite management responsibilities and are the direct representatives of the Company at their level of work.\n",
      "Employees in these classifications and any others in a supervisory capacity are not to be jacked up or disciplined through Union machinery for the acts they may have performed as supervisors in the Company's interest.\n",

      "From October 22, 1969, through December 28, 1969, the International union and its locals engaged in an economic strike against Florida Power.\n",
      "During the strike, many of the supervisors who were union members crossed the picket lines maintained at nearly all the company's operation facilities, and performed rank-and-file work normally performed by the striking nonsupervisory employees.\n",
      "Following the strike, the union brought charges against those supervisors covered by the bargaining agreement as well as those not covered, alleging violations of the International union constitution.\n",
      "Those found guilty of crossing the picket lines to perform rank-and-file work, as opposed to their usual supervisory functions, received fines ranging from $100 to $6,000 and most were expelled from the union, thereby *797 terminating their right to pension, disability, and death benefits.\n",
      "Upon charges filed by Florida Power, the Board, in reliance upon its prior decisions in Wisconsin Electric and Illinois Bell, held that the penalties imposed \"struck at the loyalty an employer should be able to expect from its representatives for the adjustment of grievances and therefore restrained and coerced employers in their selection of such representatives,\" in violation of § 8 (b) (1) (B) of the Act.\n",
      "Accordingly, the Board ordered the union to cease and desist, to rescind and refund all fines, to expunge all records of the disciplinary proceedings, and to restore those disciplined to full union membership and benefits. [7]\n",

      "In a 5-4 decision, the court held that \"[s]ection 8 (b) (1) (B) cannot reasonably be read to prohibit discipline of union memberssupervisors though they befor performance of rank-and-file struck work,\" 159 U. S. App. D. C. 272, 300, 487 F.2d 1143, 1171 (1973), and accordingly refused to enforce the Board's orders. [8]\n",
      "Section 8 (b) (1) (B), the court held, was intended to proscribe only union efforts to discipline supervisors for their actions in representing management in collective bargaining and the adjustment of grievances.\n",
      "It was the court's view that when a supervisor forsakes his supervisory role to do work normally performed by nonsupervisory employees, he no longer acts as a managerial representative and hence \"no longer merits any immunity from discipline.\"\n",

      "an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.\"\n",
      "The basic import of this provision was explained in the Senate Report as follows: \"[A] union or its responsible agents could not, without violating the law, coerce an employer into joining or resigning from an employer association which negotiates labor contracts on behalf of its members; also, this subsection would not permit a union to dictate who shall represent an employer in the settlement of employee grievances, or to compel the removal of a personnel director or supervisor who has been delegated the function of settling grievances.\" [9]\n",
      "For more than 20 years after § 8 (b) (1) (B) was enacted in 1947, the Board confined its application to situations clearly falling within the metes and bounds of the statutory language.\n",
      "Thus, in Los Angeles Cloak Joint Board ILGWU (Helen Rose Co.), 127 N. L. R. B. 1543 (1960), the Board held that § 8 (b) (1) (B) barred a union from picketing a company in an attempt to force the employer to dismiss an industrial relations consultant thought to be hostile to the union.\n",

      "Despite the absence of union pressure or coercion aimed at securing the replacement of the foremen, the Board held that the union had violated § 8 (b) (1) (B) by seeking to influence the manner in which the foremen interpreted the contract: \"That Respondent may have sought the substitution of attitudes rather than persons, and may have exerted its pressures upon the Charging Party by indirect rather than direct means, cannot alter the ultimate fact that pressure was exerted here for the purpose of interfering with the Charging Party's control over its representatives.\n",

      "These decisions reflected a further evolution of the Oakland Mailers doctrine.\n",
      "In Oakland Mailers, the union had disciplined its supervisor-members for an alleged misinterpretation or misapplication of the collective-bargaining agreement, and the Board had reasoned that the natural and foreseeable effect of such discipline was that in interpreting the agreement in the future, the supervisor would be reluctant to take a position adverse to that of the union.\n",
      "In the subsequent cases, *802 however, the Board held that the same coercive effect was likely to arise from the disciplining of a supervisor whenever he was engaged in management or supervisory activities, even though his collective-bargaining or grievance-adjustment duties were not involved.\n",
      "Through the course of these decisions, § 8 (b) (1) (B) thus began to evolve in the view of the Board and the courts \"as a general prohibition of a union's disciplining supervisor-members for their conduct in the course of representing the interests of their employers.\"\n",

      "In the present cases, the Board has extended that doctrine to hold that § 8 (b) (1) (B) forbids union discipline of supervisors for performance of rank-and-file work on the theory that the performance of such work during a strike is an activity furthering management's interests. [13]\n",
      "*803 We agree with the Court of Appeals that § 8 (b) (1) (B) cannot be so broadly read.\n",
      "Both the language and the legislative history of § 8 (b) (1) (B) reflect a clearly focused congressional concern with the protection of employers in the selection of representatives to engage in two particular and explicitly stated activities, namely collective bargaining and the adjustment of grievances.\n",
      "By its terms, the statute proscribes only union restraint or coercion of an employer \"in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances,\" and the legislative history makes clear that in enacting the provision Congress was exclusively concerned with union attempts to dictate to employers who would represent them in collective bargaining and grievance adjustment.\n",
      "The specific concern of Congress was to prevent unions from trying to force employers into or out of multi-employer bargaining units. [14]\n",
      "As Senator Taft, cosponsor of the legislation, explained: \"Under this provision it would be impossible for a union to say to a company, `We will not bargain with you unless you appoint your national employers' association as your agent so that we can bergain nationally.'\n",
      "Under the bill the employer has a right to say, `No, I will not join in national bargaining.\n",

      "*804 That the legislative creation of this unfair labor practice was in no sense intended to cut the broad swath attributed to it by the Board in the present cases is pointed up by the further observation of Senator Taft \"This unfair labor practice referred to is not perhaps of tremendous importance, but employees cannot say to their employer, `we do not like Mr. X, we will not meet Mr. X.\n",
      "You have to send us Mr. Y.' That has been done.\n",

      "Nowhere in the legislative history is there to be found any implication that Congress sought to extend protection to the employer from union restraint or coercion when engaged in any activity other than the selection of its representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining and grievance adjustment.\n",
      "The conclusion is thus inescapable that a union's discipline of one of its members who is a supervisory employee can constitute a violation of § 8 (b) (1) (B) only when that discipline may *805 adversely affect the supervisor's conduct in performing the duties of, and acting in his capacity as, grievance adjuster or collective bargainer on behalf of the employer.\n",
      "We may assume without deciding that the Board's Oakland Mailers decision fell within the outer limits of this test, but its decisions in the present cases clearly do not.\n",
      "For it is certain that these supervisors were not engaged in collective bargaining or grievance adjustment, or in any activities related thereto, when they crossed union picket lines during an economic strike to engage in rank-and-file struck work. [16]\n",
      "It is strenuously asserted, however, that to permit a union to discipline supervisor-members for performing *806 rank-and-file work during an economic strike will deprive the employer of the full loyalty of those supervisors.\n",
      "Indeed, it is precisely that concern that is reflected in these and other recent decisions of the Board holding that the statutory language \"restrain or coerce . . .\n",
      "an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances\" is not confined to situations in which the union's object is to force a change in the identity of the employer's representatives, but may properly be read to encompass any situation in which the union's actions are likely to deprive the employer of the undivided loyalty of his supervisory employees.\n",
      "As the Board stated in Wisconsin Electric: \"During the strike of the Union, the Employer clearly considered its supervisors among those it could depend on during this period.\n",
      "The Union's fining of the supervisors who were acting in the Employer's interest in performing the struck work severely jeopardized the relationship between the Employer and its supervisors.\n",
      "Thus, the fines, if found to be lawful, would now permit the Union to drive a wedge between a supervisor and the Employer, thus interfering with the performance of the duties the Employer had a right to expect the supervisor to perform.\n",
      "The Employer could no longer count on the complete and undivided loyalty of those it had selected to act as its collective-bargaining agents or to act for it in adjusting grievances.\n",
      "Moreover, such fines clearly interfere with the Employer's control over its own representatives.\n",
      "\"The purpose of Section 8 (b) (1) (B) is to assure to the employer that its selected collective-bargaining representatives will be completely faithful to its desires.\n",
      "This cannot be achieved if the union has an *807 effective method, union disciplinary action, by which it can pressure such representatives to deviate from the interests of the employer.\"\n",

      "The Board in the present cases echoes this view in arguing that \"where a supervisor is disciplined by the union for performing other supervisory or management functions, the likely effect of such discipline is to make him subservient to the union's wishes when he performs those functions in the future.\n",
      "Thus, even if the effect of this discipline did not carry over to the performance of the supervisor's grievance adjustment or collective bargaining functions, the result would be to deprive the employer of the full allegiance of, and control over, a representative he has selected for grievance adjustment or collective bargaining purposes.\"\n",

      "*808 NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267 (1974).\n",
      "Further, Congress enacted § 14 (a), 29 U.S. C. § 164 (a), explicitly providing: \"Nothing herein shall prohibit any individual employed as a supervisor from becoming or remaining a member of a labor organization, but no employer subject to this subchapter shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law, either national or local, relating to collective bargaining.\"\n",
      "Thus, while supervisors are permitted to become union members, Congress sought to assure the employer of the loyalty of his supervisors by reserving in him the right to refuse to hire union members as supervisors see Carpenters District Council v.

Co., 169 F.2d 571 (CA6 1948), and the right to refuse to engage in collective bargaining with them, The legislative history of §§ 2 (3) and 14 (a) of the Act clearly indicates that those provisions were enacted in response to the decision in Packard Motor Car Co. v. NLRB, 330 U.S. 485 (1947), in which this Court upheld the Board's finding that the statutory definition of \"employee\" included foremen, and that they were therefore entitled to the coverage of the Act in the absence of a decision by Congress to exclude them. [19 In recommending passage of this legislation, the Senate Report noted: \"It is natural to expect that unless this Congress *810 takes action, management will be deprived of the undivided loyalty of its foremen.

(Emphasis supplied.)', 'A similar concern with this conflict-of-loyalties problem was reflected in the House Report: \"The evidence before the committee shows clearly that unionizing supervisors under the Labor Act is inconsistent with . . .', \"our policy to protect the rights of employers; they, as well as workers, are entitled to loyal representatives in the plants, but when the foremen unionize, even in a union that claims to be `independent' of the union of the rank and file, they are subject to influence and control by the rank and file union, and, instead of their bossing the rank and file, the rank and file bosses them.\", '.....', '\"The bill does not forbid anyone to organize.', 'It does not forbid any employer to recognize a union of foremen.', 'Employers who, in the past, have bargained collectively with supervisors may continue to do so.', 'What the bill does is to say what the law always has said until the Labor Board, in the exercise of what it modestly calls its `expertness\\', changed the law: That no one, whether employer or employee, need have as his agent one who is obligated to those on the other side, or one whom, for any reason, *811 he does not trust.\"', 'House Report 14-17. [20]', '(', 'Emphasis supplied.)', 'It is clear that the conflict-of-loyalties problem that the Board has sought to reach under § 8 (b) (1) (B) was intended by Congress to be dealt with in a very different manner. [21 As we concluded in Beasley v. Food Fair of North Carolina, Inc., 416 U. S., at 661-662: \"This history compels the conclusion that Congress\\' dominant purpose in amending §§ 2 (3)', 'and 2 (11), and enacting § 14 (a) was to redress a perceived imbalance in labor-management relationships that was found to arise from putting supervisors in the position of serving two masters with opposed interests.\"', 'While we recognize that the legislative accommodation adopted in 1947 is fraught with difficulties of its own, \"[i]t is not necessary for us to justify the policy of Congress.', 'It is enough that we find it in the statute.\"', 'Colgate-Palmolive *812 Peet Co. v. NLRB, 338 U.S. 355 , 363 (1949). [22]', \"Congress' solution was essentially one of providing the employer with an option.\", 'On the one hand, he is at liberty to demand absolute loyalty from his supervisory personnel by insisting, on pain of discharge, that they neither participate in, nor retain membership in, a labor union, see Beasley v. Food Fair of North Carolina, Inc., *813 supra.', 'But it is quite apparent, given the statutory language and the particular concerns that the legislative history shows were what motivated Congress to enact § 8 (b) (1) (B), that it did not intend to make that provision any part of the solution to the generalized problem of supervisor-member conflict of loyalties.', 'For these reasons, we hold that the respondent unions did not violate § 8 (b) (1) (B) of the Act when they disciplined their supervisor-members for performing rank-and-file struck work.', 'Accordingly, the judgment is Affirmed.']\n",

      "5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A) (2006 ed.).\n",
      "No reason need be given for a FOIA request, and unless the requested materials fall within one of the Act's enumerated exemptions, see § 552(a)(3)(E), (b), the agency must \"make the records promptly available\" to the requester, § 552(a)(3)(A).\n",

      "The courts below held the instant FOIA suit barred by the judgment in earlier litigation seeking the same records.\n",
      "Because the lower courts' decisions turned on the connection between the two lawsuits, we begin with a full account of each action.\n",
      "The first suit was filed by Greg Herrick, an antique aircraft enthusiast and the owner of an F-45 airplane, a vintage model manufactured by the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation (FEAC) in the 1930's.\n",
      "In 1997, seeking information that would help him restore his plane to its original condition, Herrick filed a FOIA request asking the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for copies of any technical documents about the F-45 contained in the agency's records.\n",
      "To gain a certificate authorizing the manufacture and sale of the F-45, FEAC had submitted to the FAA's predecessor, the Civil Aeronautics Authority, detailed specifications and other technical data about the plane.\n",
      "Hundreds of pages of documents produced by FEAC in the certification process remain in the FAA's records.\n",
      "The FAA denied Herrick's request, however, upon finding that the documents he sought are subject to FOIA's exemption for \"trade secrets and commercial or financial *2168 information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential,\" 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4) (2006 ed.).\n",
      "In an administrative appeal, Herrick urged that FEAC and its successors had waived any trade-secret protection.\n",
      "The FAA thereupon contacted FEAC's corporate successor, respondent Fairchild Corporation (Fairchild).\n",
      "Because Fairchild objected to release of the documents, the agency adhered to its original decision.\n",
      "Herrick then filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming.\n",
      "Challenging the FAA's invocation of the trade-secret exemption, Herrick placed heavy weight on a 1955 letter from FEAC to the Civil Aeronautics Authority.\n",
      "The letter authorized the agency to lend any documents in its files to the public \"for use in making repairs or replacement parts for aircraft produced by Fairchild.\"\n",
      "Herrick v. Garvey, 298 F.3d 1184 , 1193 (C.A.10 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n",
      "This broad authorization, Herrick maintained, showed that the F-45 certification records held by the FAA could not be regarded as \"secre[t]\" or \"confidential\" within the meaning of § 552(b)(4).\n",
      "Rejecting Herrick's argument, the District Court granted summary judgment to the FAA.\n",
      "Herrick v. Garvey, 200 F. Supp.\n",
      "2d 1321 , 1328-1329 (D.Wyo.2000).\n",
      "The 1955 letter, the court reasoned, did not deprive the F-45 certification documents of trade-secret status, for those documents were never in fact released pursuant to the letter's blanket authorization.\n",
      "See id., at 1329.\n",
      "The court also stated that even if the 1955 letter had waived trade-secret protection, Fairchild had successfully \"reversed\" the waiver by objecting to the FAA's release of the records to Herrick.\n",
      "Ibid.\n",
      "On appeal, the Tenth Circuit agreed with Herrick that the 1955 letter had stripped the requested documents of trade-secret protection.\n",
      "See Herrick, 298 F.3d, at 1194.\n",
      "But the Court of Appeals upheld the District Court's alternative determination i.e., that Fairchild had restored trade-secret status by objecting to Herrick's FOIA request.\n",
      "Id., at 1195.\n",
      "On that ground, the appeals court affirmed the entry of summary judgment for the FAA.\n",
      "In so ruling, the Tenth Circuit noted that Herrick had failed to challenge two suppositions underlying the District Court's decision.\n",
      "First, the District Court assumed trade-secret status could be \"restored\" to documents that had lost protection.\n",
      "Id., at 1194, n. 10.\n",
      "Second, the District Court also assumed that Fairchild had regained trade-secret status for the documents even though the company claimed that status only \"after Herrick had initiated his request\" for the F-45 records.\n",
      "Ibid.\n",
      "The Court of Appeals expressed no opinion on the validity of these suppositions.\n",
      "See id., at 1194-1195, n. 10.\n",
      "The Tenth Circuit's decision issued on July 24, 2002.\n",
      "Less than a month later, on August 22, petitioner Brent Taylora friend of Herrick's and an antique aircraft enthusiast in his own rightsubmitted a FOIA request seeking the same documents Herrick had unsuccessfully sued to obtain.\n",
      "When the FAA failed to respond, Taylor filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n",
      "Like Herrick, Taylor argued that FEAC's 1955 letter had stripped the records of their trade-secret status.\n",
      "But Taylor also sought to litigate the two issues concerning recapture of protected status that Herrick had failed to raise in his appeal to the Tenth Circuit.\n",
      "After Fairchild intervened as a defendant, [1] *2169 the District Court in D.C. concluded that Taylor's suit was barred by claim preclusion; accordingly, it granted summary judgment to Fairchild and the FAA.\n",
      "The court acknowledged that Taylor was not a party to Herrick's suit.\n",
      "Relying on the Eighth Circuit's decision in Tyus v. Schoemehl, 93 F.3d 449 (1996), however, it held that a nonparty may be bound by a judgment if she was \"virtually represented\" by a party.\n",

      "30a-31a.\n",
      "The Eighth Circuit's seven-factor test for virtual representation, adopted by the District Court in Taylor's case, requires an \"identity of interests\" between the person to be bound and a party to the judgment.\n",
      "See id., at 31a.\n",
      "See also Tyus, 93 F.3d, at 455.\n",
      "Six additional factors counsel in favor of virtual representation under the Eighth Circuit's test, but are not prerequisites: (1) a \"close relationship\" between the present party and a party to the judgment alleged to be preclusive; (2) \"participation in the prior litigation\" by the present party; (3) the present party's \"apparent acquiescence\" to the preclusive effect of the judgment; (4) \"deliberat[e] maneuver[ing]\" to avoid the effect of the judgment; (5) adequate representation of the present party by a party to the prior adjudication; and (6) a suit raising a \"public law\" rather than a \"private law\" issue.\n",

      "App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a (citing Tyus, 93 F.3d, at 454-456)\n",
      ".\n",
      "These factors, the D.C. District Court observed, \"constitute a fluid test with imprecise boundaries\" and call for \"a broad, case-by-case inquiry.\"\n",
      "App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a.\n",
      "The record before the District Court in Taylor's suit revealed the following facts about the relationship between Taylor and Herrick: Taylor is the president of the Antique Aircraft Association, an organization to which Herrick belongs; the two men are \"close associate[s],\" App. 54; Herrick asked Taylor to help restore Herrick's F-45, though they had no contract or agreement for Taylor's participation in the restoration; Taylor was represented by the lawyer who represented Herrick in the earlier litigation; and Herrick apparently gave Taylor documents that Herrick had obtained from the FAA during discovery in his suit.\n",
      "Fairchild and the FAA conceded that Taylor had not participated in Herrick's suit.\n",
      "App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a.\n",
      "The D.C. District Court determined, however, that Herrick ranked as Taylor's virtual representative because the facts fit each of the other six indicators on the Eighth Circuit's list.\n",
      "See id., at 32a-35a.\n",
      "Accordingly, the District Court held Taylor's suit, seeking the same documents Herrick had requested, barred by the judgment against Herrick.\n",
      "See id., at 35a.\n",
      "The D.C. Circuit affirmed.\n",
      "It observed, first, that other Circuits \"vary widely\" in their approaches to virtual representation.\n",
      "Taylor v. Blakey, 490 F.3d 965 , 971 (2007).\n",
      "In this regard, the D.C. Circuit contrasted the multifactor balancing test applied by the Eighth Circuit and the D.C. District Court with the Fourth Circuit's narrower approach, which \"treats a party as a virtual representative only if the party is `accountable to the nonparties who file a subsequent suit' and has `the tacit approval of the court' to act on the nonpart[ies'] behalf.\"\n",
      "Ibid. (quoting Klugh v. United States, 818 F.2d 294 , 300 (C.A.4 1987)\n",
      ")\n",
      ".\n",
      "Rejecting both of these approaches, the D.C. Circuit announced its own five-factor *2170 test.\n",
      "The first two factors\"identity of interests\" and \"adequate representation\" are necessary but not sufficient for virtual representation.\n",
      "490 F.3d, at 971-972.\n",
      "In addition, at least one of three other factors must be established: \"a close relationship between the present party and his putative representative,\" \"substantial participation by the present party in the first case,\" or \"tactical maneuvering on the part of the present party to avoid preclusion by the prior judgment.\"\n",
      "Id., at 972.\n",
      "Applying this test to the record in Taylor's case, the D.C. Circuit found both of the necessary conditions for virtual representation well met.\n",
      "As to identity of interests, the court emphasized that Taylor and Herrick sought the same resultrelease of the F-45 documents.\n",
      "Moreover, the D.C. Circuit observed, Herrick owned an F-45 airplane, and therefore had \"if anything, a stronger incentive to litigate\" than Taylor, who had only a \"general interest in public disclosure and the preservation of antique aircraft heritage.\"\n",
      "Id., at 973 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n",
      "Turning to adequacy of representation, the D.C. Circuit acknowledged that some other Circuits regard notice of a prior suit as essential to a determination that a nonparty was adequately represented in that suit.\n",
      "See id., at 973-974 (citing Perez v. Volvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d 303 , 312 (C.A.1 2001), and Tice v. American Airlines, Inc., 162 F.3d 966, 973 (C.A.7 1998)).\n",
      "Disagreeing with these courts, the D.C. Circuit deemed notice an \"important\" but not an indispensable element in the adequacy inquiry.\n",
      "The court then concluded that Herrick had adequately represented Taylor even though Taylor had received no notice of Herrick's suit.\n",
      "For this conclusion, the appeals court relied on Herrick's \"strong incentive to litigate\" and Taylor's later engagement of the same attorney, which indicated to the court Taylor's satisfaction with that attorney's performance in Herrick's case.\n",
      "See 490 F.3d, at 974-975.\n",
      "The D.C. Circuit also found its \"close relationship\" criterion met, for Herrick had \"asked Taylor to assist him in restoring his F-45\" and \"provided information to Taylor that Herrick had obtained through discovery\"; furthermore, Taylor \"did not oppose Fairchild's characterization of Herrick as his `close associate.'\" Id., at 975.\n",
      "Because the three above-described factors sufficed to establish virtual representation under the D.C. Circuit's five-factor test, the appeals court left open the question whether Taylor had engaged in \"tactical maneuvering.\"\n",
      "See id., at 976 (calling the facts bearing on tactical maneuvering \"ambigu[ous]\"). [2]\n",

Our second reason for rejecting a broad doctrine of virtual representation rests on the limitations attending nonparty preclusion based on adequate representation. A party's representation of a nonparty is \"adequate\" for preclusion purposes only if, at a minimum: (1)\n",

      "An all-things-considered balancing approach might spark wide-ranging, time-consuming, and expensive discovery tracking factors potentially relevant under seven- or five-prong tests.\n",

      "To support this position, the FAA offers two arguments.\n",

      "; Brief for National Security Archive et al. as Amici Curiae 10 (\"Government agencies do not systematically make released records available to the general public.\").\n",
      "Thus, in contrast to the public-law litigation contemplated in Richards, a successful FOIA action results in a grant of relief to the individual plaintiff, not a decree benefiting the public at large.\n",
      "Furthermore, we said in Richards only that, for the type of public-law claims there envisioned, States are free to adopt procedures limiting repetitive litigation.\n",
      "See 517 U.S., at 803 , 116 S. Ct. 1761 .\n",

      "It hardly follows, however, that this Court should proscribe or confine successive FOIA suits by different requesters.\n",
      "Indeed, Congress' provision for FOIA suits with no statutory constraint on successive actions counsels against judicial imposition of constraints *2178 through extraordinary application of the common law of preclusion.\n",

      "For the foregoing reasons, we disapprove the theory of virtual representation on which the decision below rested.\n",

      "In some cases, however, lower courts have relied on virtual representation to extend nonparty preclusion beyond the latter doctrine's proper bounds.\n",

      "It is uncontested that four of the six grounds for nonparty preclusion have no application here: There is no indication that Taylor agreed to be bound by Herrick's litigation, that Taylor and Herrick have any legal relationship, that Taylor exercised any control over Herrick's suit, or that this suit implicates any special statutory scheme limiting relitigation.\n",
      "Neither the FAA nor Fairchild contends otherwise.\n",
      "It is equally clear that preclusion cannot be justified on the theory that Taylor was adequately represented in Herrick's suit.\n",
      "Nothing in the record indicates that Herrick understood himself to be suing on Taylor's behalf, that Taylor even knew of Herrick's suit, or that the Wyoming District Court took special care to protect Taylor's interests.\n",

      "There are, however, some helpful indicators.\n",
      "If a taxpayer, as Groetzinger is stipulated to have done in 1978, devotes his full-time activity to gambling, and it is his intended livelihood source, it would seem that basic concepts of fairness (if there be much of that in the income tax law) demand that his activity be regarded as a trade or business just as any other readily accepted activity, such as being a retail store proprietor or, to come closer categorically, as being a casino operator or as being an active trader on the exchanges.\n",

      "Surely, one who clearly satisfies the Frankfurter adumbration usually is in a trade or business.\n",

      "One might well feel that a full-time gambler *34 ought to qualify as much as a full-time trader, [12] as Justice Brandeis in Snyder implied and as courts have held. [13]\n",

      "In any event, while the offering of goods and services usually would qualify the activity as a trade or business, this factor, it seems to us, is not an absolute prerequisite.\n",

      "See Brief for Petitioner 36.\n",
      "It might assist now and then, when the answer is obvious and positive, but it surely is capable of breeding litigation over the meaning of \"goods,\" the meaning of \"services,\" or the meaning of \"holding one's self out.\"\n",
      "And we suspect that  apart from gambling  almost every activity would satisfy the gloss. [14]\n",
      "A test that everyone passes is not a test at all.\n",

      "Of course, not every income-producing and profit-making endeavor constitutes a trade or business.\n",

      "We accept the fact that to be engaged in a trade or business, the taxpayer must be involved in the activity with continuity and regularity and that the taxpayer's primary purpose for engaging in the activity must be for income or profit.\n",
      "A sporadic activity, a hobby, or an amusement diversion does not qualify.\n",
      "It is suggested that we should defer to the position taken by the Commissioner and by the Solicitor General, but, in the absence of guidance, for over several decades now, through the medium of definitive statutes or regulations, we see little reason to do so.\n",
      "We would defer, instead, to the Code's normal focus on what we regard as a common-sense concept of what is a trade or business.\n",
      "Otherwise, as here, in the context of a minimum tax, it is not too extreme to say that the taxpayer is being taxed on his gambling losses, [15] a result distinctly out of line with the Code's focus on income.\n",
      "We do not overrule or cut back on the Court's holding in Higgins when we conclude that if one's gambling activity is pursued full time, in good faith, and with regularity, to the production of income for a livelihood, and is not a mere hobby, it is a trade or business within the meaning of the statutes with which we are here concerned.\n",

adjustment of grievances .', \"By its terms , the statute proscribes only union restraint or coercion of an employer `` in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances , '' and the legislative history makes clear that in enacting the provision Congress was exclusively concerned with union attempts to dictate to employers who would represent them in collective bargaining and grievance adjustment .\", 'The specific concern of Congress was to prevent unions from trying to force employers into or out of multi-employer bargaining units .', \"[ 14 ] As Senator Taft , cosponsor of the legislation , explained : `` Under this provision it would be impossible for a union to say to a company , ` We will not bargain with you unless you appoint your national employers ' association as your agent so that we can bergain nationally .\", \"' Under the bill the employer has a right to say , ` No , I will not join in

employee can constitute a violation of § 8 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ) only when that discipline may * 805 adversely affect the supervisor 's conduct in performing the duties of , and acting in his capacity as

supervisor-members for performing * 806 rank-and-file work during an economic strike will deprive the employer of the full loyalty of those supervisors .', 'Indeed , it is precisely that concern that is reflected in these and other recent decisions of the Board holding that the statutory language `` restrain or coerce .', '.', '.', \"an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances '' is not confined to situations in which the union 's object is to force a change in the identity of the employer 's representatives

in Wisconsin Electric : `` During the strike of the Union , the Employer clearly considered its supervisors among those it could depend on during this period .', \"The Union 's fining of the supervisors who were acting in the Employer 's interest in performing the struck work severely jeopardized the relationship between the Employer and its supervisors .\", 'Thus , the fines , if found

to perform .', 'The Employer could no longer count on the complete and undivided loyalty of those it had selected to act as its collective-bargaining agents or to act for it in adjusting grievances

which it can pressure such representatives to deviate from the interests of the employer .', \"'' 192 N.\", 'L.', 'R.', 'B.', ', at 78 .', \"The Board in the present cases echoes this view in arguing that `` where a supervisor is disciplined by the union for performing other supervisory or management functions , the likely effect of such discipline is to make him subservient to the union 's wishes when he performs those functions in the future .\", \"Thus , even if the effect of this discipline did not carry over to the performance of the supervisor 's grievance adjustment or collective
