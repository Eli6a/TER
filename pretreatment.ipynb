      "['MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nA jury in New Hampshire Superior Court awarded respondent damages in this civil libel action based on one of petitioner\\'s columns in the Laconia Evening Citizen.\\nRespondent alleged that the column contained defamatory falsehoods concerning his performance as Supervisor of the Belknap Country Recreation Area, a facility owned and operated by Belknap County.\\nIn the interval between the trial and the decision of petitioner\\'s appeal by the New Hampshire Supreme Court, we decided New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 .\\nWe there held that consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments a State cannot award damages to a public official for defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless the official proves actual malice\\x97that the falsehood was published with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of whether it was true or false.\\nThe New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed the award, finding New York Times no bar.\\n106 N. H. 26, 203 A. 2d 773.\\nWe granted certiorari and requested the parties to brief and argue, in addition to the questions presented in the petition for certiorari, the question whether respondent was a \"public official\" under New York Times and under our decision in Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64 . 380 U. S. 941.\\nThe Recreation Area was used principally as a ski resort but also for other recreational activities.\\nRespondent was employed by and directly responsible to the Belknap County Commissioners, three elected officials in charge of the county government.\\nDuring the 1950\\'s, a public controversy developed over the way respondent and the Commissioners operated the Area; some protested that respondent and the Commissioners had not developed the *78 Area\\'s full potential, either as a resort for local residents or as a tourist attraction that might contribute to the county\\'s taxes.\\nsome protested that respondent and the Commissioners had not developed the *78 Area\\'s full potential, either as a resort for local residents or as a tourist attraction that might contribute to the county\\'s taxes.\\nThe discussion culminated in 1959, when the New Hampshire Legislature enacted a law transferring control of the Area to a special five-man commission. [1]\\nAt least in part to give this new regime a fresh start, respondent was discharged.\\nPetitioner regularly contributed an unpaid column to the Laconia Evening Citizen.\\nIn it he frequently commented on political matters.\\nAs an outspoken proponent of the change in operations at the Recreation Area, petitioner\\'s views were often sharply stated, and he had indicated disagreement with the actions taken by respondent and the County Commissioners.\\nIn January 1960, during the first ski season under the new management, some six months after respondent\\'s discharge, petitioner published the column that respondent alleges libeled him.\\nIn relevant part, it reads:\\n\"Been doing a little listening and checking at Belknap Recreation Area and am thunderstruck by what am learning. \"This year, a year without snow till very late, a year with actually few very major changes in procedure; the difference in cash income simply fantastic, almost unbelievable. \"On any sort of comparative basis, the Area this year is doing literally hundreds of per cent BETTER than last year. \"When consider that last year was excellent snow year, that season started because of more snow, months earlier last year, one can only ponder following question: \"What happened to all the money last year? and every other year? What magic has Dana Beane *79 [Chairman of the new commission] and rest of commission, and Mr. Warner [respondent\\'s replacement as Supervisor] wrought to make such tremendous difference in net cash results?\"\\nThe column on its face contains no clearly actionable statement.\\nAlthough the questions \"What happened to all the money last year? and every other year?\" could be read to imply peculation, they could also be read, in context, merely to praise the present administration.\\nThe only persons mentioned by name are officials of the new regime; no reference is made to respondent, the three elected commissioners, or anyone else who had a part in the administration of the Area during respondent\\'s tenure.\\nno reference is made to respondent, the three elected commissioners, or anyone else who had a part in the administration of the Area during respondent\\'s tenure\\nPersons familiar with the controversy over the Area might well read it as complimenting the luck or skill of the new management in attracting increased patronage and producing a \"tremendous difference in net cash results\" despite less favorable snow; indeed, witnesses for petitioner testified that they so read the column.\\nindeed, witnesses for petitioner testified that they so read the column.\\nRespondent offered extrinsic proofs to supply a defamatory meaning.\\nThese proofs were that the column greatly exaggerated any improvement under the new regime, and that a large part of the community understood it to say that the asserted improvements were not explicable by anything the new management had done.\\nRather, his witnesses testified, they read the column as imputing mismanagement and peculation during respondent\\'s tenure.\\nRespondent urged two theories to support a recovery based on that imputation.\\nThe first was that the jury could award him damages if it found that the column cast suspicion indiscriminately *80 on the small number of persons who composed the former management group, whether or not it found that the imputation of misconduct was specifically made of and concerning him. [2]\\nThis theory of recovery was open to respondent under New Hampshire law; the trial judge explicitly instructed the jury that \"an imputation of impropriety or a crime to one or some of a small group that casts suspicion upon all is actionable.\" [3]\\nThe question is presented, however, whether that theory of recovery is precluded by our holding in New York Times that, in the absence of sufficient evidence that the attack focused on the plaintiff, an otherwise impersonal attack on governmental operations cannot be utilized to establish a libel of those administering the operations.\\n376 U. S., at 290-292 .\\nThe plaintiff in New York Times was one of the three elected Commissioners of the City of Montgomery, Alabama.\\nHis duties included the supervision of the police department.\\nThe statements in the advertisement upon which he principally relied as referring to him were that \"truckloads of police . . . ringed the Alabama State College Campus\" after a demonstration on the State Capitol steps, and that Dr. Martin Luther King had been \"arrested . . . seven times.\"\\nThese statements were false in that although the police had been \"deployed near the campus,\" they had not actually \"ringed\" it and had not gone there in connection with a State Capitol demonstration, and in that Dr. King had been arrested only *81 four times.\\nWe held that evidence that Sullivan as Police Commissioner was the supervisory head of the Police Department was constitutionally insufficient to show that the statements about police activity were \"of and concerning\" him; we rejected as inconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments the proposition followed by the Alabama Supreme Court in the case that \"[i]n measuring the performance or deficiencies of . . . groups, praise or criticism is usually attached to the official in complete control of the body,\"\\nwe rejected as inconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments the proposition followed by the Alabama Supreme Court in the case that \"[i]n measuring the performance or deficiencies of . . . groups, praise or criticism is usually attached to the official in complete control of the body,\" 273 Ala. 656, 674-675, 144 So. 2d 25, 39.\\nTo allow the jury to connect the statements with Sullivan on that presumption alone was, in our view, to invite the spectre of prosecutions for libel on government, which the Constitution does not tolerate in any form.\\n376 U. S., at 273-276, 290-292 . [4]\\nWe held \"that such a proposition may not constitutionally be utilized to establish that an otherwise impersonal attack on governmental operations was a libel of an official responsible for those operations.\"\\n376 U. S., at 292 .\\nThere must be evidence showing that the attack was read as specifically directed at the plaintiff.\\nWere the statement at issue in this case an explicit charge that the Commissioners and Baer or the entire Area management were corrupt, we assume without deciding that any member of the identified group might recover. [5]\\nThe statement itself might be sufficient evidence that the attack was specifically directed at each individual.\\nEven if a charge and reference were merely implicit, as is alleged here, but a plaintiff could show by extrinsic proofs that the statement referred to him, it would be no defense to a suit by one member of an *82 identifiable group engaged in governmental activity that another was also attacked.\\nThese situations are distinguishable from the present case; here, the jury was permitted to infer both defamatory content and reference from the challenged statement itself, although the statement on its face is only an impersonal discussion of government activity.\\nTo the extent the trial judge authorized the jury to award respondent a recovery without regard to evidence that the asserted implication of the column was made specifically of and concerning him, we hold that the instruction was erroneous. [6]\\nHere, no explicit charge of peculation was made; no assault on the previous management appears.\\nThe jury was permitted to award damages upon a finding merely that respondent was one of a small group acting for an organ of government, only some of whom were implicated, but all of whom were tinged with suspicion.\\nIn effect, this permitted the jury to find liability merely on the basis of his relationship to the government agency, the operations of which were the subject of discussion.\\nIt is plain that the elected Commissioners, also members of that group, *83 would have been barred from suit on this theory under New York Times.\\nThey would be required to show specific reference.\\nWhether or not respondent was a public official, as a member of the group he bears the same burden. [7]\\nA theory that the column cast indiscriminate suspicion on the members of the group responsible for the conduct of this governmental operation is tantamount to a demand for recovery based on libel of government, and therefore is constitutionally insufficient.\\nSince the trial judge\\'s instructions were erroneous in this respect, the judgment must be reversed.\\nRespondent\\'s second theory, supported by testimony of several witnesses, was that the column was read as referring specifically to him, as the \"man in charge\" at the Area, personally responsible for its financial affairs.\\nEven accepting respondent\\'s reading, the column manifestly discusses the conduct of operations of government. [8]\\nThe subject matter may have been only of local interest, but at least here, where publication was addressed primarily to the interested community, that fact is constitutionally irrelevant.\\nThe question is squarely presented whether the \"public official\" designation under New York Times applies.\\nIf it does, it is clear that the jury instructions were improper.\\nUnder the instructions, the jury was permitted *84 to find that negligent misstatement of fact would defeat petitioner\\'s privilege.\\nThat test was rejected in Garrison, 379 U. S., at 79 , where we said, \"The test which we laid down in New York Times is not keyed to ordinary care; defeasance of the privilege is conditioned, not on mere negligence, but on reckless disregard for the truth.\"\\nThe trial court also charged that \"[d]efamatory matter which constitutes comment rather than fact is justified if made without malice and represented fair comment on matters of public interest,\" and defined malice to include \"ill will, evil motive, intention to injure . . . .\"\\nThis definition of malice is constitutionally insufficient where discussion of public affairs is concerned; \"[w]e held in New York Times that a public official might be allowed the civil remedy only if he establishes that the utterance was false and that it was made with knowledge of its falsity or in reckless disregard of whether it was false or true.\"\\nGarrison, 379 U. S., at 74 .\\nTurning, then, to the question whether respondent was a \"public official\" within New York Times, we reject at the outset his suggestion that it should be answered by reference to state-law standards.\\nStates have developed definitions of \"public official\" for local administrative purposes, not the purposes of a national constitutional protection. [9]\\nIf existing state-law standards reflect the purposes of New York Times, this is at best accidental.\\nOur decision in New York Times, moreover, draws its force from the constitutional protections afforded free expression.\\nThe standards that set the scope of its principles cannot therefore be such that \"the constitutional limits of free expression in the Nation would vary with state lines.\"\\nPennekamp v. Florida, 328 U. S. 331 , 335. [10]\\n*85 We remarked in New York Times that we had no occasion \"to determine how far down into the lower ranks of government employees the `public official\\' designation would extend for purposes of this rule, or otherwise to specify categories of persons who would or would not be included.\"\\n376 U. S., at 283, n. 23 .\\nNo precise lines need be drawn for the purposes of this case.\\nThe motivating force for the decision in New York Times was twofold.\\nWe expressed \"a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that [such debate] may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\"\\n376 U. S., at 270 .\\nThere is, first, a strong interest in debate on public issues, and, second, a strong interest in debate about those persons who are in a position significantly to influence the resolution of those issues.\\nCriticism of government is at the very center of the constitutionally protected area of free discussion.\\nCriticism of those responsible for government operations must be free, lest criticism of government itself be penalized.\\nt is clear, therefore, that the \"public official\" designation applies at the very least to those among the hierarchy of government employees who have, or appear to the public to have, substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs. [11]\\n*86 This conclusion does not ignore the important social values which underlie the law of defamation.\\nSociety has a pervasive and strong interest in preventing and redressing attacks upon reputation.\\nBut in cases like the present, there is tension between this interest and the values nurtured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\\nThe thrust of New York Times is that when interests in public discussion are particularly strong, as they were in that case, the Constitution limits the protections afforded by the law of defamation.\\nWhere a position in government has such apparent importance that the public has an independent interest in the qualifications and performance of the person who holds it, beyond the general public interest in the qualifications and performance of all government employees, both elements we identified in New York Times are present [12] and the New York Times malice standards apply. [13]\\n*87 As respondent framed his case, he may have held such a position.\\nSince New York Times had not been decided when his case went to trial, his presentation was not shaped to the \"public official\" issue.\\nHe did, however, seek to show that the article referred particularly to him.\\nHis theory was that his role in the management of the Area was so prominent and important that the public regarded him as the man responsible for its operations, chargeable with its failures and to be credited with its successes.\\nThus, to prove the article referred to him, he showed the importance of his role; the same showing, at the least, raises a substantial argument that he was a \"public official.\" [14]\\nThe record here, however, leaves open the possibility that respondent could have adduced proofs to bring his claim outside the New York Times rule.\\nMoreover, even if the claim falls within New York Times, the record suggests respondent may be able to present a jury question of malice as there defined.\\nBecause the trial here was had before New York Times, we have concluded that we should not foreclose him from attempting retrial of his *88 action.\\nWe remark only that, as is the case with questions of privilege generally, it is for the trial judge in the first instance to determine whether the proofs show respondent to be a \"public official.\" [15]\\nThe judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the New Hampshire Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\\nIt is so ordered.\\n', 'JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nThese cases involve 42 U.S. C . §262(l), which was en- acted as part of the Biologics Price Competition and Inno- vation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), 124 Stat. 808.\\nThe BPCIA governs a type of drug called a biosimilar, which is a biologic product that is highly similar to a biologic product that has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\\nUnder §262(l), an applicant that seeks FDA approval of a biosimilar must provide its appli- cation materials and manufacturing information to the manufacturer of the corresponding biologic within 20 days of the date the FDA notifies the applicant that it has accepted the application for review.\\nThe applicant then must give notice to the manufacturer at least 180 days before marketing the biosimilar commercially.\\nThe first question presented by these cases is whether the requirement that an applicant provide its application and manufacturing information to the manufacturer of the biologic is enforceable by injunction.\\nWe conclude that an injunction is not available under federal law, but we re- mand for the court below to decide whether an injunction is available under state law.\\nThe second question is whether the applicant must give notice to the manufac- turer after, rather than before, obtaining a license from the FDA for its biosimilar. We conclude that an applicant may provide notice before obtaining a license.\\nWe conclude that an applicant may provide notice before obtaining a license.\\nThe complex statutory scheme at issue in these cases establishes processes both for obtaining FDA approval of biosimilars and for resolving patent disputes between manufacturers of licensed biologics and manufacturers of biosimilars.\\nBefore turning to the questions presented, we first explain the statutory background.\\nA biologic is a type of drug derived from natural, biologi- cal sources such as animals or microorganisms.\\niologics thus differ from traditional drugs, which are typically synthesized from chemicals.1\\nA manufacturer of a biologic may market the drug only if the FDA has licensed it pur- suant to either of two review processes set forth in §262.\\nThe default pathway for approval, used for new biologics, is set forth in §262(a).\\nUnder that subsection, the FDA may license a new biologic if, among other things, the manufacturer demonstrates that it is “safe, pure, and potent.”\\n§262(a)(2)(C)(i)(I).\\nIn addition to this default route, the statute also prescribes an alternative, abbrevi- ated route for FDA approval of biosimilars, which is set forth in §262(k).\\nTo obtain approval through the BPCIA’s abbreviated process, the manufacturer of a biosimilar (applicant) does not need to show that the product is “safe, pure, and po- tent.”\\nInstead, the applicant may piggyback on the show- ing made by the manufacturer (sponsor) of a previously licensed biologic (reference product).\\nSee §262(k)(2)(A)(iii).\\nAn applicant must show that its product is “highly simi- lar” to the reference product and that there are no “clini- cally meaningful differences” between the two in terms of “safety, purity, and potency.”\\n§§262(i)(2)(A), (B)\\nsee also §262(k)(2)(A)(i)(I).\\nAn applicant may not submit an appli- cation until 4 years after the reference product is first licensed, and the FDA may not license a biosimilar until 12 years after the reference product is first licensed.\\n§§262(k)(7)(A), (B).\\nAs a result, the manufacturer of a new biologic enjoys a 12-year period when its biologic may be marketed without competition from biosimilars.\\nA sponsor may hold multiple patents covering the bio- logic, its therapeutic uses, and the processes used to man- ufacture it.\\nThose patents may constrain an applicant’s ability to market its biosimilar even after the expiration of the 12-year exclusivity period contained in §262(k)(7)(A).\\nThe BPCIA facilitates litigation during the period pre- ceding FDA approval so that the parties do not have to wait until commercial marketing to resolve their patent disputes.\\nIt enables the parties to bring infringement actions at certain points in the application process, even if the applicant has not yet committed an act that would traditionally constitute patent infringement.\\nSee 35 U.S. C . §271(a) (traditionally infringing acts include making, using, offering to sell, or selling any patented invention within the United States without authority to do so).\\nSee 35 U.S. C . §271(a) (traditionally infringing acts include making, using, offering to sell, or selling any patented invention within the United States without authority to do so).\\nSpecifically, it provides that the mere submission of a biosimilar application constitutes an act of infringement.\\n§§271(e)(2)(C)(i), (ii).\\nWe will refer to this kind of preap- proval infringement as “artificial” infringement.\\nSection 271(e)(4) provides remedies for artificial infringement, including injunctive relief and damages.\\nThe BPCIA sets forth a carefully calibrated scheme for preparing to adjudicate, and then adjudicating, claims of infringement.\\nSee 42 U.S. C . §262(l).\\nWhen the FDA accepts an application for review, it notifies the applicant, who within 20 days “shall provide” to the sponsor a copy of the application and information about how the biosimilar is manufactured.\\n§262(l)(2)(A).\\nThe applicant also “may provide” the sponsor with any additional information that it requests.\\n§262(l)(2)(B).\\nThese disclosures enable the sponsor to evaluate the biosimilar for possible infringe- ment of patents it holds on the reference product (i.e., the corresponding biologic).\\n§262(l)(1)(D).\\nThe information the applicant provides is subject to strict confidentiality rules, enforceable by injunction.\\nSee §262(l)(1)(H).\\nThe first question presented by these cases is whether §262(l)(2)(A)’s requirement—that the applicant provide its application and manufacturing information to the spon- sor—is itself enforceable by injunction.\\nAfter the applicant makes the requisite disclosures, the parties exchange information to identify relevant patents and to flesh out the legal arguments that they might raise in future litigation.\\nWithin 60 days of receiving the appli- cation and manufacturing information, the sponsor “shall provide” to the applicant “a list of patents” for which it believes it could assert an infringement claim if a person without a license made, used, offered to sell, sold, or im- ported “the biological product that is the subject of the [biosimilar] application.”\\n§262(l)(3)(A)(i).\\nThe sponsor must also identify any patents on the list that it would be willing to license.\\n§262(l)(3)(A)(ii).\\nNext, within 60 days of receiving the sponsor’s list, the applicant may provide to the sponsor a list of patents that the applicant believes are relevant but that the sponsor omitted from its own list, §262(l)(3)(B)(i), and “shall pro- vide” to the sponsor reasons why it could not be held liable for infringing the relevant patents, §262(l)(3)(B)(ii).\\nThe applicant may argue that the relevant patents are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, or the applicant may agree not to market the biosimilar until a particular pat- ent has expired.\\nIbid.\\nThe applicant must also respond to the sponsor’s offers to license particular patents.\\n§262(l)(3)(B)(iii).\\nThen, within 60 days of receiving the applicant’s responses, the sponsor “shall provide” to the applicant its own arguments concerning infringement, enforceability, and validity as to each relevant patent.\\n§262(l)(3)(C).\\nFollowing this exchange, the BPCIA channels the par- ties into two phases of patent litigation.\\nIn the first phase, the parties collaborate to identify patents that they would like to litigate immediately. The second phase is triggered by the applicant’s notice of commercial marketing and involves any patents that were included on the parties’ §262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase.\\nThe second phase is triggered by the applicant’s notice of commercial marketing and involves any patents that were included on the parties’ §262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase.\\nAt the outset of the first phase, the applicant and the sponsor must negotiate to determine which patents in- cluded on the §262(l)(3) lists will be litigated immediately.\\nSee §§262(l)(4)(A), (l)(6).\\nIf they cannot agree, then they must engage in another list exchange.\\n§262(l)(4)(B).\\nThe applicant “shall notify” the sponsor of the number of pat- ents it intends to list for litigation, §262(l)(5)(A), and, within five days, the parties “shall simultaneously ex- change” lists of the patents they would like to litigate immediately.\\n§262(l)(5)(B)(i).\\nThis process gives the applicant substantial control over the scope of the first phase of litigation: The number of patents on the sponsor’s list is limited to the number contained in the applicant’s list, though the sponsor always has the right to list at least one patent.\\n§262(l)(5)(B)(ii).\\nThe parties then proceed to litigate infringement with respect to the patents they agreed to litigate or, if they failed to agree, the patents contained on the lists they simultaneously exchanged under §262(l)(5).\\n§§262(l)(6)(A), (B).\\nSection 271(e)(2)(C)(i) facilitates this first phase of litigation by making it an act of artificial infringement, with respect to any patent included on the parties’ §262(l)(3) lists, to submit an application for a license from the FDA.\\nThe sponsor “shall bring an action” in court within 30 days of the date of agreement or the simultane- ous list exchange.\\n§§262(l)(6)(A), (B).\\nIf the sponsor brings a timely action and prevails, it may obtain a rem- edy provided by §271(e)(4).\\nThe second phase of litigation involves patents that were included on the original §262(l)(3) lists but not liti- gated in the first phase (and any patents that the sponsor acquired after the §262(l)(3) exchange occurred and added to the lists, see §262(l)(7)).\\nThe second phase is com- menced by the applicant’s notice of commercial marketing, which the applicant “shall provide” to the sponsor “not later than 180 days before the date of the first commercial marketing of the biological product licensed under subsec- tion (k).”\\n§262(l)(8)(A).\\nThe BPCIA bars any declaratory judgment action prior to this notice.\\n§262(l)(9)(A) (prohib- iting, in situations where the parties have complied with each step of the BPCIA process, either the sponsor or the applicant from seeking a “declaration of infringement, validity, or enforceability of any patent” that was included on the §262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase “prior to the date notice is received under paragraph (8)(A)”).\\n§262(l)(9)(A) (prohib- iting, in situations where the parties have complied with each step of the BPCIA process, either the sponsor or the applicant from seeking a “declaration of infringement, validity, or enforceability of any patent” that was included on the §262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase “prior to the date notice is received under paragraph (8)(A)”).\\nBecause the applicant (subject to certain con- straints) chooses when to begin commercial marketing and when to give notice, it wields substantial control over the timing of the second phase of litigation.\\nBecause the applicant (subject to certain con- straints) chooses when to begin commercial marketing and when to give notice, it wields substantial control over the timing of the second phase of litigation.\\nThe second ques- tion presented is whether notice is effective if an appli- cant provides it prior to the FDA’s decision to license the biosimilar.\\nIn this second phase of litigation, either party may sue for declaratory relief.\\nSee §262(l)(9)(A).\\nIn addition, prior to the date of first commercial marketing, the sponsor may “seek a preliminary injunction prohibiting the [biosimilar] applicant from engaging in the commercial manufacture or sale of [the biosimilar] until the court decides the issue of patent validity, enforcement, and infringement with respect to any patent that” was included on the §262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase.\\n§262(l)(8)(B).\\nIf the parties comply with each step outlined in the BPCIA, they will have the opportunity to litigate the relevant patents before the biosimilar is marketed.\\nTo encourage parties to comply with its procedural require- ments, the BPCIA includes various consequences for failing to do so.\\nTwo of the BPCIA’s remedial provisions are at issue here.\\nUnder §262(l)(9)(C), if an applicant fails to provide its application and manufacturing information to the sponsor—thus effectively pretermitting the entire two-phase litigation process—then the sponsor, but not the applicant, may immediately bring an action “for a declaration of infringement, validity, or enforceability of any patent that claims the biological product or a use of the biological product.”\\nSection 271(e)(2)(C)(ii) facilitates this action by making it an artificial act of infringement, with respect to any patent that could have been included on the §262(l)(3) lists, to submit a biosimilar application.\\nSimilarly, when an applicant provides the application and manufacturing information but fails to complete a subse- quent step, §262(l)(9)(B) provides that the sponsor, but not the applicant, may bring a declaratory-judgment action with respect to any patent included on the sponsor’s §262(l)(3)(A) list of patents (as well as those it acquired later and added to the list).\\nAs noted, it is an act of artifi- cial infringement, with respect to any patent on the §262(l)(3) lists, to submit an application to the FDA. See §271(e)(2)(C)(i).\\nSee §271(e)(2)(C)(i).\\nThese cases concern filgrastim, a biologic used to stimu- late the production of white blood cells.\\nAmgen, the re- spondent in No. 15–1039 and the petitioner in No. 15– 1195, has marketed a filgrastim product called Neupogen since 1991 and claims to hold patents on methods of man- ufacturing and using filgrastim.\\nIn May 2014, Sandoz, the petitioner in No. 15–1039 and the respondent in No. 15– 1195, filed an application with the FDA seeking approval to market a filgrastim biosimilar under the brand name Zarxio, with Neupogen as the reference product.\\nThe FDA informed Sandoz on July 7, 2014, that it had accepted the application for review.\\nOne day later, Sandoz notified Amgen both that it had submitted an application and that it intended to begin marketing Zarxio immediately upon receiving FDA approval, which it expected in the first half of 2015.\\nSandoz later confirmed that it did not intend to provide the requisite application and manufacturing information under §262(l)(2)(A) and informed Amgen that Amgen could sue for infringement immediately under §262(l)(9)(C).\\nIn October 2014, Amgen sued Sandoz for patent in- fringement.\\nAmgen also asserted two claims under Cali- fornia’s unfair competition law, which prohibits “any unlawful . . . business act or practice.” Cal.

Bank of America, N. A., 57 Cal. 4th 390, 396, 304 P.3d 181 , 185 (2013).\\nAmgen alleged that Sandoz engaged in “unlawful” conduct when it failed to provide its application and manufacturing information under §262(l)(2)(A), and when it provided notice of com- mercial marketing under §262(l)(8)(A) before, rather than after, the FDA licensed its biosimilar.\\nAmgen sought injunctions to enforce both requirements.\\nSandoz counter- claimed for declaratory judgments that the asserted pat- ent was invalid and not infringed and that it had not violated the BPCIA.\\nWhile the case was pending in the District Court, the FDA licensed Zarxio, and Sandoz provided Amgen a fur- ther notice of commercial marketing.\\nThe District Court subsequently granted partial judgment on the pleadings to Sandoz on its BPCIA counterclaims and dismissed Amgen’s unfair competition claims with prejudice.\\n2015 WL 1264756 , *7–*9 (ND Cal., Mar. 19, 2015).\\nAfter the District Court entered final judgment as to these claims, Amgen appealed to the Federal Circuit, which granted an injunction pending appeal against the commercial market- ing of Zarxio.\\nA divided Federal Circuit affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.

S. ___ (2017).\\n580 U. S. ___ (2017).\\nThe first question we must answer is whether §262(l)(2)(A)’s requirement that an applicant provide the sponsor with its application and manufacturing infor- mation is enforceable by an injunction under either federal or state law.\\nWe agree with the Federal Circuit that an injunction under federal law is not available to enforce §262(l)(2)(A), though for slightly different reasons than those provided by the court below.\\nhe Federal Circuit held that “ 42 U.S. C . §262(l)(9)(C) and 35 U.S. C . §271(e) expressly provide the only remedies” for a violation of §262(l)(2)(A), 794 F.3d, at 1357 , and neither of those provisions author- izes a court to compel compliance with §262(l)(2)(A).\\nIn concluding that the remedies specified in the BPCIA are exclusive, the Federal Circuit relied primarily on §271(e)(4), which states that it provides “ ‘the only reme- dies which may be granted by a court for an act of [artifi- cial] infringement.’ ”\\nId., at 1356 (emphasis deleted).\\nThe flaw in the Federal Circuit’s reasoning is that Sandoz’s failure to disclose its application and manufac- turing information was not an act of artificial infringe- ment, and thus was not remediable under §271(e)(4).\\nSubmitting an application constitutes an act of artificial infringement.\\nSee §§271(e)(2)(C)(i), (ii) (“It shall be an act of infringement to submit . . . an application seeking approval of a biological product”).\\nFailing to disclose the application and manufacturing information under §262(l)(2)(A) does not.\\nIn reaching the opposite conclusion, the Federal Circuit relied on §271(e)(2)(C)(ii), which states that “[i]t shall be an act of infringement to submit[,] if the applicant for the application fails to provide the application and infor- mation required under [§262(l)(2)(A)], an application seeking approval of a biological product for a patent that could be identified pursuant to [§262(l)(3)(A)(i)].”\\nThe court appeared to conclude, based on the italicized language, that an applicant’s noncompliance with §262(l)(2)(A) is an element of the act of artificial infringement (along with the submission of the applica- tion). 794 F.3d, at 1356 .\\n794 F.3d, at 1356\\nWe disagree.\\nThe italicized language merely assists in identifying which patents will be the subject of the artificial infringement suit.\\nIt does not define the act of artificial infringement itself.\\nThis conclusion follows from the structure of §271(e)(2)(C).\\nClause (i) of §271(e)(2)(C) defines artificial infringement in the situation where the parties proceed through the list exchange process and the patents subject to suit are those contained in the §262(l)(3) lists, as sup- plemented under §262(l)(7).\\nThat clause provides that it is an act of artificial infringement to submit, “with respect to a patent that is identified in the list of patents described in [§262(l)(3)] (including as provided under [§262(l)(7)]), an application seeking approval of a biological product.”\\nClause (ii) of §271(e)(2)(C), in contrast, defines artificial infringement in the situation where an applicant fails to disclose its application and manufactur- ing information altogether and the parties never prepare the §262(l)(3) lists.\\nThat clause provides that the submis- sion of the application represents an act of artificial in- fringement with respect to any patent that could have been included on the lists.\\nIn this way, the two clauses of §271(e)(2)(C) work in tandem.\\nThey both treat submission of the application as the act of artificial infringement for which §271(e)(4) provides the remedies.\\nAnd they both identify the patents subject to suit, although by different means depending on whether the applicant disclosed its application and manu- facturing information under §262(l)(2)(A).\\nIf the applicant made the disclosures, clause (i) applies; if it did not, clause (ii) applies.\\nIn neither instance is the applicant’s failure to provide its application and manufacturing information an element of the act of artificial infringement, and in neither instance does §271(e)(4) provide a remedy for that failure.\\nSee Brief for Amgen Inc. et al. 66–67 (conceding both points).\\nA separate provision of §262, however, does provide a remedy for an applicant’s failure to turn over its applica- tion and manufacturing information.\\nWhen an applicant fails to comply with §262(l)(2)(A), §262(l)(9)(C) authorizes the sponsor, but not the applicant, to bring an immediate declaratory-judgment action for artificial infringement as defined in §271(e)(2)(C)(ii).\\nSection 262(l)(9)(C) thus vests in the sponsor the control that the applicant would other- wise have exercised over the scope and timing of the patent litigation.\\nIt also deprives the applicant of the certainty that it could have obtained by bringing a declaratory-judgment action prior to marketing its product.\\nThe remedy provided by §262(l)(9)(C) excludes all other federal remedies, including injunctive relief.\\nWhere, as here, “a statute expressly provides a remedy, courts must be especially reluctant to provide additional remedies.”\\nKarahalios v. Federal Employees, 489 U.S. 527 , 533 (1989).\\nThe BPCIA’s “carefully crafted and detailed en- forcement scheme provides strong evidence that Congress did not intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to incorporate expressly.”\\nGreat-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204 , 209 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).\\nThe presence of §262(l)(9)(C), coupled with the absence of any other textually specified remedies, indicates that Congress did not intend sponsors to have access to injunctive relief, at least as a matter of federal law, to enforce the disclosure requirement.\\nStatutory context further confirms that Congress did not authorize courts to enforce §262(l)(2)(A) by injunction.\\nSection 262(l)(1)(H) provides that “the court shall consider immediate injunctive relief to be an appropriate and nec- essary remedy for any violation or threatened violation” of the rules governing the confidentiality of information disclosed under §262(l).\\nWe assume that Congress acted intentionally when it provided an injunctive remedy for breach of the confidentiality requirements but not for breach of §262(l)(2)(A)’s disclosure requirement.\\nCf. Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560 , 572 (1979) (“[W]hen Congress wished to provide a private damage remedy, it knew how to do so and did so expressly”).2\\nCf. Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560 , 572 (1979) (“[W]hen Congress wished to provide a private damage remedy, it knew how to do so and did so expressly”).2\\nAccordingly, the Federal Circuit properly declined to grant an injunction under federal law.\\nThe Federal Circuit rejected Amgen’s request for an injunction under state law for two reasons.\\nFirst, it inter- preted California’s unfair competition law not to provide a remedy when the underlying statute specifies an “expressly . . . exclusive”\\nremedy. 794 F.3d, at 1360 (citing Cal.\\nIt further held that §271(e)(4), by its text, “provides ‘the only remedies’ ” for an applicant’s failure to disclose its applica- tion and manufacturing information.\\n794 F.3d, at 1360 (quoting §271(e)(4)).\\nThe court thus concluded that no state remedy was available for Sandoz’s alleged violation of §262(l)(2)(A) under the terms of California’s unfair competition law.\\nThis state-law holding rests on an incorrect interpreta- tion of federal law.\\nAs we have explained, failure to com- ply with §262(l)(2)(A) is not an act of artificial infringe- ment.\\nBecause §271(e)(4) provides remedies only for artificial infringement, it provides no remedy at all, much less an “expressly . . . exclusive” one, for Sandoz’s failure to comply with §262(l)(2)(A).\\nSecond, the Federal Circuit held in the alternative that Sandoz’s failure to disclose its application and manufac- turing information was not “unlawful” under California’s unfair competition law.\\nIn the court’s view, when an applicant declines to provide its application and manufac- turing information to the sponsor, it takes a path “expressly contemplated by” §262(l)(9)(C) and §271(e)(2)(C)(ii) and thus does not violate the BPCIA. 794 F.3d, at 1357 , 1360.\\n794 F.3d, at 1357 , 1360.\\nIn their briefs before this Court, the parties frame this issue as whether the §262(l)(2)(A) requirement is manda- tory in all circumstances, see Brief for Amgen Inc. et al. 58, or merely a condition precedent to the information exchange process, see Reply Brief for Sandoz Inc. 33.\\nIn their briefs before this Court, the parties frame this issue as whether the §262(l)(2)(A) requirement is manda- tory in all circumstances, see Brief for Amgen Inc. et al. 58, or merely a condition precedent to the information exchange process, see Reply Brief for Sandoz Inc. 33.\\nIf it is only a condition precedent, then an applicant effectively has the option to withhold its application and manufactur- ing information and does not commit an “unlawful” act in doing so.\\nWe decline to resolve this particular dispute definitively because it does not present a question of federal law.\\nThe BPCIA, standing alone, does not require a court to decide whether §262(l)(2)(A) is mandatory or conditional; the court need only determine whether the applicant supplied the sponsor with the information required under §262(l)(2)(A).\\nIf the applicant failed to provide that infor- mation, then the sponsor, but not the applicant, could bring an immediate declaratory-judgment action pursuant to §262(l)(9)(C).\\nThe parties in these cases agree—as did the Federal Circuit—that Sandoz failed to comply with §262(l)(2)(A), thus subjecting itself to that consequence.\\nThe parties in these cases agree—as did the Federal Circuit—that Sandoz failed to comply with §262(l)(2)(A), thus subjecting itself to that consequence.\\nThe parties in these cases agree—as did the Federal Circuit—that Sandoz failed to comply with §262(l)(2)(A), thus subjecting itself to that consequence.\\nThere is no dispute about how the federal scheme actually works, and thus nothing for us to decide as a matter of federal law.\\nThe mandatory or conditional nature of the BPCIA’s requirements matters only for purposes of Cali- fornia’s unfair competition law, which penalizes “unlaw- ful” conduct.\\nWhether Sandoz’s conduct was “unlawful” under the unfair competition law is a state-law question, and the court below erred in attempting to answer that question by referring to the BPCIA alone.\\nOn remand, the Federal Circuit should determine whether California law would treat noncompliance with §262(l)(2)(A) as “unlawful.”\\nIf the answer is yes, then the court should proceed to determine whether the BPCIA pre-empts any additional remedy available under state law for an applicant’s failure to comply with §262(l)(2)(A) (and whether Sandoz has forfeited any pre-emption de- fense, see 794 F.3d, at 1360 , n. 5).\\nThe court is also of course free to address the pre-emption question first by assuming that a remedy under state law exists.\\nThe second question at issue in these cases is whether an applicant must provide notice after the FDA licenses its biosimilar, or if it may also provide effective notice before licensure.\\nSection 262(l)(8)(A) states that the applicant “shall provide notice to the reference product sponsor not later than 180 days before the date of the first commercial marketing of the biological product licensed under subsec- tion (k).”\\nThe Federal Circuit held that an applicant’s biosimilar must already be “licensed” at the time the applicant gives notice.\\n794 F.3d, at 1358\\nWe disagree.\\nThe applicant must give “notice” at least 180 days “before the date of the first commercial market- ing.”\\n“[C]ommercial marketing,” in turn, must be “of the biological product licensed under subsection (k).”\\n§262(l)(8)(A).\\nBecause this latter phrase modifies “com- mercial marketing” rather than “notice,” “commercial marketing” is the point in time by which the biosimilar must be “licensed.”\\nThe statute’s use of the word “li- censed” merely reflects the fact that, on the “date of the first commercial marketing,” the product must be “li- censed.”\\nSee §262(a)(1)(A).\\nAccordingly, the applicant may provide notice either before or after receiving FDA approval.\\nStatutory context confirms this interpretation.\\nSection 262(l)(8)(A) contains a single timing requirement: The applicant must provide notice at least 180 days prior to marketing its biosimilar.\\nThe Federal Circuit, however, interpreted the provision to impose two timing require- ments: The applicant must provide notice after the FDA licenses the biosimilar and at least 180 days before the applicant markets the biosimilar.\\nAn adjacent provision expressly sets forth just that type of dual timing require- ment.\\nSee §262(l)(8)(B) (“After receiving notice under subparagraph (A) and before such date of the first com- mercial marketing of such biological product, the reference product sponsor may seek a preliminary injunction” (em- phasis added)).\\nBut Congress did not use that structure in §262(l)(8)(A).\\n“Had Congress intended to” impose two timing requirements in §262(l)(8)(A), “it presumably would have done so expressly as it did in the immediately following” subparagraph.\\nRussello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16 , 23 (1983).\\nWe are not persuaded by Amgen’s arguments to the contrary.\\nAmgen points out that other provisions refer to “ ‘the biological product that is the subject of ’ ” the applica- tion, rather than the “ ‘biological product licensed under subsection (k).’ ”\\nBrief for Amgen Inc. et al. 28 (emphasis added).\\nIn its view, this variation “is a strong textual indication that §262(l)(8)(A), unlike the other provisions, refers to a product that has already been ‘licensed’ by the FDA.”\\nIbid.\\nAmgen’s interpretation is not necessary to harmonize Congress’ use of the two different phrases.\\nThe provision upon which Amgen primarily relies (and that is generally illustrative of the other provisions it cites) requires the applicant to explain why the sponsor’s patents are “ ‘inva- lid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the commer- cial marketing of the biological product that is the subject of the subsection (k) application.’ ”\\nId., at 29–30 (quoting §262(l)(3)(B)(ii)(I); emphasis deleted).\\nThis provision uses the phrase “subject of the subsection (k) application” rather than “product licensed under subsection (k)” be- cause the applicant can evaluate validity, enforceability, and infringement with respect to the biosimilar only as it exists when the applicant is conducting the evaluation, which it does before licensure.\\nThe applicant cannot make the same evaluation with respect to the biosimilar as it will exist after licensure, because the biosimilar’s specifi- cations may change during the application process.\\nSee, e.g., 794 F.3d, at 1358\\nIn contrast, nothing in §262(l)(8)(A) turns on the precise status or characteristics of the biosimilar application.\\nAmgen also advances a host of policy arguments that prelicensure notice is undesirable.\\nSee Brief for Amgen Inc. et al. 35–42.\\nSandoz and the Government, in turn, respond with their own bevy of arguments that Amgen’s concerns are misplaced and that prelicensure notice af- firmatively furthers Congress’ intent.\\nSee Brief for Sandoz Inc. 39–42, 56; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28–29.\\nThe plausibility of the contentions on both sides illustrates why such disputes are appropriately addressed to Congress, not the courts.\\nEven if we were persuaded that Amgen had the better of the policy argu- ments, those arguments could not overcome the statute’s plain language, which is our “primary guide” to Congress’ preferred policy.\\nMcFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849 , 865 (1994) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\\nIn sum, because Sandoz fully complied with §262(l)(8)(A) when it first gave notice (before licensure) in July 2014, the Federal Circuit erred in issuing a federal injunction prohibiting Sandoz from marketing Zarxio until 180 days after licensure.\\nFurthermore, because Amgen’s request for state-law relief is predicated on its argument that the BPCIA forbids prelicensure notice, its claim under California’s unfair competition law also fails.\\nWe accordingly reverse the Federal Circuit’s judgment as to the notice provision.\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated in part and reversed in part, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\nIt is so ordered.\\n', \"Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nClaiming he was the original and sole inventor of a mechanical device, the respondent Kepner asked the United States Patent Office for a patent\\nLater the petitioner Sanford filed a similar application making the same claim.\\nAs authorized by R.S. § 4904, 35 U.S.C. § 52, 35 U.S.C.A. § 52, the Commissioner of Patents directed a board of interference examiners to hold hearings and determine the dispute over priority of invention—which of the two first used the device.\\nThe Board decided for respondent Kepner.\\nSanford's application for patent was accordingly refused.\\nAs authorized by R.S. § 4915, 35 U.S.C. § 63, 35 U.S.C.A. § 63, Sanford brought this bill in equity praying that he be adjudged inventor of the device and entitled to a patent.\\nSanford also prayed that Kepner's claims be adjudged unpatentable, charging that many previous patents had been granted on Kepner's device, some of which had expired.\\nAgreeing with the Board of Interference Examiners, the District Court found against Sanford on the issue of prior use.\\nSince this was enough to justify refusal to issue Sanford a patent, the District Court declined to go further and consider Kepner's claim to a patent.\\nAccordingly Sanford's bill was dismissed.\\n99 F. Supp. 221.\\nAgreeing with the District Court, the Court of Appeals affirmed. 3 Cir., 195 F.2d 387 .\\nThe circuits have different views concerning the duty of district courts to consider and adjudicate questions of invention and patentability when parties urge them in R.S. § 4915 proceedings. 1\\nTo settle these differences we granted certiorari.\\n343 U.S. 976, 72 S. Ct. 1075.\\nSo far as relevant to the precise question here, R.S. § 4915, as now contained in 35 U.S.C. § 63, 35 U.S.C.A. § 63, reads:\\n* * * whenever any applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the board of interference examiners, the applicant * * * may have remedy by bill in equity * * * and the court * * * may adjudge that such applicant is entitled, according to law, to receive a patent for his invention * * *. And such adjudication, if it be in favor of the right of the applicant, shall authorize the commissioner to issue such patent on the applicant filing in the Patent Office a copy of the adjudication and otherwise complying with the requirements of law.'\\nThe obvious purpose of the quoted part of R.S. § 4915 is to give a judicial remedy to an applicant who has been finally denied a patent because of a Patent Office decision against him and in favor of his adversary on the question of priority.\\nWhen the trial court decides this factual issue of priority against him and thus affirms the refusal of the patent by the Patent Office, he has obtained the full remedy the statute gives him.\\nOnly if he wins on priority may he proceed.\\nIn that event, the statute says, the court may proceed to 'adjudge that such applicant is entitled, according to law, to receive a patent for his invention * * *.'\\nSo adjudging, it may authorize issuance of the patent.\\nBut judicial authorization of issuance implies judicial sanction of patentability and for this reason this Court has said, 'It necessarily follows that no adjudication can be made in favor of the applicant, unless the alleged invention for which a patent is sought is a patentable invention.'\\nHill v. Wooster, 132 U.S. 693 , 698, 10 S. Ct. 228 , 230, 33 L.

Ed. 1488 , requires us to say R.S. § 4915 compels a district court to adjudicate patentability at the instance of one whose claim is found to be groundless.\\nSanford's claim was found to be groundless.\\nIt is unlikely that this equity proceeding would develop a full investigation of validity.\\nThere would be no attack on the patent comparable to that of an infringement action.\\nHere the very person who claimed an invention now asks to prove that Kepner's similar device was no invention at all because of patents issued long before either party made claim for his discovery.\\nThere is no real issue of invention between the parties here and we see no reason to read into the statute a district court's compulsory duty to adjudicate validity.\\nAffirmed.\\n\", 'JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nWe consider under what circumstances, if any, a district judge is free to “determin[e] that three judges are not required” for an action “challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts.”\\n28 U. S. C. §§2284 (a), (b)(1).\\nRare today, three-judge district courts were more com- mon in the decades before 1976, when they were required for various adjudications, including the grant of an “inter- locutory or permanent injunction restraining the enforce- ment, operation or execution of any State statute . . . upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute.”\\n28 U. S. C. §2281 (1970 ed.), repealed, Pub. L. 94–381, §1, 90 Stat. 1119 . See Currie, The Three-Judge District Court in Constitutional Litigation, 32 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1 , 3–12 (1964).\\nDecisions of three-judge courts could, then as now, be appealed as of right directly to this Court.\\n28 U. S. C. §1253\\nIn 1976, Congress substantially curtailed the circum- stances under which a three-judge court is required.\\nIt was no longer required for the grant of an injunction against state statutes, see Pub. L. 94–381, §1, 90 Stat. 1119 (repealing 28 U. S. C. §2281 ), but was mandated for “an action . . . challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts or the apportion- ment of any statewide legislative body.”\\nId., §3, now codified at 28 U. S. C. §2284 (a).\\nSimultaneously, Congress amended the procedures governing three-judge district courts.\\nThe prior statute had provided:\\n“The district judge to whom the application for injunction or other relief is presented shall constitute one member of [the three-judge] court. On the filing of the application, he shall immediately notify the chief judge of the circuit, who shall designate two other judges” to serve.\\n28 U. S. C. §2284 (1) (1970 ed.).\\nThe amended statute provides:\\n“Upon the filing of a request for three judges, the judge to whom the request is presented shall, unless he determines that three judges are not required, immediately notify the chief judge of the circuit, who shall designate two other judges” to serve.\\n28 U. S. C. §2284 (b)(1) (2012 ed.) (emphasis added).\\nThe dispute here concerns the scope of the italicized text.\\nIn response to the 2010 Census, Maryland enacted a statute in October 2011 establishing—or, more pejora- tively, gerrymandering—the districts for the State’s eight congressional seats.\\nDissatisfied with the crazy-quilt results, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a, petitioners, a bipar- tisan group of citizens, filed suit pro se in Federal District Court.\\nTheir amended complaint alleges, inter alia, that Maryland’s redistricting plan burdens their First Amend- ment right of political association.\\nPetitioners also re- quested that a three-judge court be convened to hear the case.\\nThe District Judge, however, thought the claim “not one for which relief can be granted.”\\nBenisek v. Mack, 11 F. Supp. 3d 516 , 526 (Md. 2014).\\n“[N]othing about the congressional districts at issue in this case affects in any proscribed way [petitioners’] ability to participate in the political debate in any of the Maryland congressional districts in which they might find themselves. They are free to join preexisting political committees, form new ones, or use whatever other means are at their disposal to influence the opinions of their congressional representa- tives.”\\nIbid. (brackets, ellipsis, and internal quotation marks omitted).\\nFor that reason, instead of notifying the Chief Judge of the Circuit of the need for a three-judge court, the District Judge dismissed the action.\\nThe Fourth Circuit summar- ily affirmed in an unpublished disposition.\\nBenisek v. Mack, 584 Fed. Appx. 140 (CA4 2014).\\nSeeking review in this Court, petitioners pointed out that at least two other Circuits consider it reversible error for a district judge to dismiss a case under §2284 for failure to state a claim for relief rather than refer it for transfer to a three-judge court.\\nSee LaRouche v. Fowler, 152 F. 3d 974 , 981–983 (CADC 1998); LULAC v. Texas, 113 F. 3d 53 , 55–56 (CA5 1997) (per curiam).\\nWe granted certiorari.\\nShapiro v. Mack, 576 U. S. ___ (2015).\\nPetitioners’ sole contention is that the District Judge had no authority to dismiss the case rather than initiate the procedures to convene a three-judge court.\\nNot so, argue respondents;\\nthe 1976 addition to §2284(b)(1) of the clause “unless he determines that three judges are not required” is precisely such a grant of authority.\\nMoreover, say respondents, Congress declined to specify a standard to constrain the exercise of this authority.\\nChoosing, as the District Judge did, the familiar standard for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) best serves the purposes of a three-judge court, which (in respondents’ view) is to protect States from “hasty, imprudent invalida- tion” of their statutes by rogue district judges acting alone.\\nBrief for Respondents 27.\\nWhatever the purposes of a three-judge court may be, respondents’ argument needlessly produces a contradic- tion in the statutory text.\\nThat text’s initial prescription could not be clearer:\\n“A district court of three judges shall be convened . . . when an action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts . . . .”\\n28 U. S. C. §2284 (a) (emphasis added).\\nNobody disputes that the present suit is “an action . . . challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts.”\\nIt follows that the district judge was required to refer the case to a three-judge court, for §2284(a) admits of no exception, and “the mandatory ‘shall’ . . . normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion.”\\nLexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U. S. 26 , 35 (1998); see also National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U.

S. 644 , 661–662 (2007) (same).\\nThe subsequent provision of §2284(b)(1), that the dis- trict judge shall commence the process for appointment of a three-judge panel “unless he determines that three judges are not required,” need not and therefore should not be read as a grant of discretion to the district judge to ignore §2284(a).\\nIt is not even framed as a proviso, or an exception from that provision, but rather as an adminis- trative detail that is entirely compatible with §2284(a).\\nThe old §2284(1) triggered the district judge’s duty to refer the matter for the convening of a three-judge court “[o]n the filing of the application” to enjoin an unconstitutional state law.\\nBy contrast, the current §2284(b)(1) triggers the district judge’s duty “[u]pon the filing of a request for three judges” (emphasis added).\\nBut of course a party may—whether in good faith or bad, through ignorance or hope or malice—file a request for a three-judge court even if the case does not merit one under §2284(a).\\nSection 2284(b)(1) merely clarifies that a district judge need not unthinkingly initiate the procedures to convene a three- judge court without first examining the allegations in the complaint.\\nIn short, all the district judge must “deter- min[e]” is whether the “request for three judges” is made in a case covered by §2284(a)—no more, no less.\\nThat conclusion is bolstered by §2284(b)(3)’s explicit command that “[a] single judge shall not . . . enter judg- ment on the merits.”\\nIt would be an odd interpretation that allowed a district judge to do under §2284(b)(1) what he is forbidden to do under §2284(b)(3).\\nMore likely that Congress intended a three-judge court, and not a single district judge, to enter all final judgments in cases satisfy- ing the criteria of §2284(a).\\nRespondents argue in the alternative that a district judge is not required to refer a case for the convening of a three-judge court if the constitutional claim is (as they assert petitioners’ claim to be) “insubstantial.”\\nIn Goosby v. Osser, 409 U. S. 512 (1973), we stated that the filing of a “constitutionally insubstantial” claim did not trigger the three-judge-court requirement under the pre-1976 statu- tory regime.\\nId., at 518\\nGoosby rested not on an interpre- tation of statutory text, but on the familiar proposition that “[i]n the absence of diversity of citizenship, it is es- sential to jurisdiction that a substantial federal question should be presented.”\\nEx parte Poresky, 290 U. S. 30 , 31 (1933) (per curiam) (emphasis added).\\nAbsent a substan- tial federal question, even a single-judge district court lacks jurisdiction, and “[a] three-judge court is not re- quired where the district court itself lacks jurisdiction of the complaint or the complaint is not justiciable in the federal courts.”\\nGonzalez v. Automatic Employees Credit Union, 419 U. S. 90 , 100 (1974).\\nIn the present case, however, the District Judge dis- missed petitioners’ complaint not because he thought he lacked jurisdiction, but because he concluded that the allegations failed to state a claim for relief on the merits, citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. 662 (2009), and Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544 (2007).\\nSee 11 F. Supp. 3d, at 520.\\nThat was in accord with Fourth Cir- cuit precedent, which holds that where the “pleadings do not state a claim, then by definition they are insubstantial and so properly are subject to dismissal by the district court without convening a three-judge court.”\\nDuckworth v. State Admin. Bd. of Election Laws, 332 F. 3d 769 , 772– 773 (CA4 2003) (emphasis added).\\nWe think this standard both too demanding and incon- sistent with our precedents.\\n“[C]onstitutional claims will not lightly be found insubstantial for purposes of ” the three-judge-court statute.\\nWashington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134 , 147–148 (1980).\\nWe have long distinguished between failing to raise a substantial federal question for jurisdictional purposes—which is what Goosby addressed—and failing to state a claim for relief on the merits; only “wholly insub- stantial and frivolous” claims implicate the former.\\nBell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678 , 682–683 (1946); see also Hannis Distilling Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 216 U. S. 285 , 288 (1910) (“obviously frivolous or plainly in- substantial”); Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U. S. 31 , 33 (1962) (per curiam) (“wholly insubstantial,” “legally speaking non-existent,” “essentially fictitious”); Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83 , 89 (1998) (“frivolous or immaterial”).\\nAbsent such frivolity, “the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.”\\nBell, supra, at 682.\\nConsistent with this principle, Goosby clarified that “ ‘[c]onstitutional insubstantiality’ for this purpose has been equated with such concepts as ‘essen- tially fictitious,’ ‘wholly insubstantial,’ ‘obviously frivolous,’ and ‘obviously without merit.’ ”\\n409 U. S., at 518 (citations omitted).\\nAnd the adverbs were no mere throwaways; “[t]he limiting words ‘wholly’ and ‘obviously’ have cogent legal significance.”\\nIbid.\\nWithout expressing any view on the merits of petition- ers’ claim, we believe it easily clears Goosby’s low bar;\\nafter all, the amended complaint specifically challenges Maryland’s apportionment “along the lines suggested by Justice Kennedy in his concurrence in Vieth [v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267 (2004)].”\\nApp. to Brief in Opposition 44.\\nAlthough the Vieth plurality thought all political gerry- mandering claims nonjusticiable, JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring in the judgment, surmised that if “a State did impose burdens and restrictions on groups or persons by reason of their views, there would likely be a First Amendment violation, unless the State shows some com- pelling interest. . . . Where it is alleged that a gerryman- der had the purpose and effect of imposing burdens on a disfavored party and its voters, the First Amendment may offer a sounder and more prudential basis for intervention than does the Equal Protection Clause.”\\nVieth v. Ju- belirer, 541 U. S. 267 , 315 (2004).\\nWhatever “wholly in- substantial,” “obviously frivolous,” etc., mean, at a mini- mum they cannot include a plea for relief based on a legal theory put forward by a Justice of this Court and uncon- tradicted by the majority in any of our cases.\\nAccordingly, the District Judge should not have dismissed the claim as “constitutionally insubstantial” under Goosby.\\nPerhaps petitioners will ultimately fail on the merits of their suit, but §2284 entitles them to make their case before a three- judge district court.\\nThe judgment of the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\nIt is so ordered.\\n', 'Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\"It is a principle of general application in Anglo-American jurisprudence that one is not bound by a judgment in personam *2167 in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process.\"\\nHansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32 , 40, 61 S. Ct. 115 , 85 L. Ed. 22 (1940).\\nSeveral exceptions, recognized in this Court\\'s decisions, temper this basic rule\\nIn a class action, for example, a person not named as a party may be bound by a judgment on the merits of the action, if she was adequately represented by a party who actively participated in the litigation.\\nSee id., at 41, 61 S. Ct. 115 .\\nIn this case, we consider for the first time whether there is a \"virtual representation\" exception to the general rule against precluding nonparties.\\nAdopted by a number of courts, including the courts below in the case now before us, the exception so styled is broader than any we have so far approved.\\nThe virtual representation question we examine in this opinion arises in the following context.\\nPetitioner Brent Taylor filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act seeking certain documents from the Federal Aviation Administration.\\nGreg Herrick, Taylor\\'s friend, had previously brought an unsuccessful suit seeking the same records.\\nThe two men have no legal relationship, and there is no evidence that Taylor controlled, financed, participated in, or even had notice of Herrick\\'s earlier suit.\\nNevertheless, the D.C. Circuit held Taylor\\'s suit precluded by the judgment against Herrick because, in that court\\'s assessment, Herrick qualified as Taylor\\'s \"virtual representative.\"\\nWe disapprove the doctrine of preclusion by \"virtual representation,\" and hold, based on the record as it now stands, that the judgment against Herrick does not bar Taylor from maintaining this suit.\\nThe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) accords \"any person\" a right to request any records held by a federal agency. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A) (2006 ed.).\\n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A) (2006 ed.).\\nNo reason need be given for a FOIA request, and unless the requested materials fall within one of the Act\\'s enumerated exemptions, see § 552(a)(3)(E), (b), the agency must \"make the records promptly available\" to the requester, § 552(a)(3)(A).\\nIf an agency refuses to furnish the requested records, the requester may file suit in federal court and obtain an injunction \"order[ing] the production of any agency records improperly withheld.\" § 552(a)(4)(B).\\n§ 552(a)(4)(B).\\nThe courts below held the instant FOIA suit barred by the judgment in earlier litigation seeking the same records.\\nBecause the lower courts\\' decisions turned on the connection between the two lawsuits, we begin with a full account of each action.\\nThe first suit was filed by Greg Herrick, an antique aircraft enthusiast and the owner of an F-45 airplane, a vintage model manufactured by the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation (FEAC) in the 1930\\'s.\\nIn 1997, seeking information that would help him restore his plane to its original condition, Herrick filed a FOIA request asking the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for copies of any technical documents about the F-45 contained in the agency\\'s records.\\nTo gain a certificate authorizing the manufacture and sale of the F-45, FEAC had submitted to the FAA\\'s predecessor, the Civil Aeronautics Authority, detailed specifications and other technical data about the plane.\\nHundreds of pages of documents produced by FEAC in the certification process remain in the FAA\\'s records.\\nThe FAA denied Herrick\\'s request, however, upon finding that the documents he sought are subject to FOIA\\'s exemption for \"trade secrets and commercial or financial *2168 information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential,\" 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4) (2006 ed.).\\nIn an administrative appeal, Herrick urged that FEAC and its successors had waived any trade-secret protection.\\nThe FAA thereupon contacted FEAC\\'s corporate successor, respondent Fairchild Corporation (Fairchild).\\nBecause Fairchild objected to release of the documents, the agency adhered to its original decision.\\nHerrick then filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming.\\nChallenging the FAA\\'s invocation of the trade-secret exemption, Herrick placed heavy weight on a 1955 letter from FEAC to the Civil Aeronautics Authority.\\nThe letter authorized the agency to lend any documents in its files to the public \"for use in making repairs or replacement parts for aircraft produced by Fairchild.\"\\nHerrick v. Garvey, 298 F.3d 1184 , 1193 (C.A.10 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).\\nThis broad authorization, Herrick maintained, showed that the F-45 certification records held by the FAA could not be regarded as \"secre[t]\" or \"confidential\" within the meaning of § 552(b)(4).\\nRejecting Herrick\\'s argument, the District Court granted summary judgment to the FAA.\\nHerrick v. Garvey, 200 F. Supp. 2d 1321 , 1328-1329 (D.Wyo.2000).\\nThe 1955 letter, the court reasoned, did not deprive the F-45 certification documents of trade-secret status, for those documents were never in fact released pursuant to the letter\\'s blanket authorization.\\nSee id., at 1329.\\nThe court also stated that even if the 1955 letter had waived trade-secret protection, Fairchild had successfully \"reversed\" the waiver by objecting to the FAA\\'s release of the records to Herrick.\\nIbid.\\nOn appeal, the Tenth Circuit agreed with Herrick that the 1955 letter had stripped the requested documents of trade-secret protection.\\nSee Herrick, 298 F.3d, at 1194.\\nBut the Court of Appeals upheld the District Court\\'s alternative determination \\x97i.e., that Fairchild had restored trade-secret status by objecting to Herrick\\'s FOIA request.\\nId., at 1195.\\nOn that ground, the appeals court affirmed the entry of summary judgment for the FAA.\\nIn so ruling, the Tenth Circuit noted that Herrick had failed to challenge two suppositions underlying the District Court\\'s decision.\\nFirst, the District Court assumed trade-secret status could be \"restored\" to documents that had lost protection.\\nId., at 1194, n. 10.\\nSecond, the District Court also assumed that Fairchild had regained trade-secret status for the documents even though the company claimed that status only \"after Herrick had initiated his request\" for the F-45 records.\\nIbid.\\nThe Court of Appeals expressed no opinion on the validity of these suppositions.\\nSee id., at 1194-1195, n. 10.\\nThe Tenth Circuit\\'s decision issued on July 24, 2002.\\nLess than a month later, on August 22, petitioner Brent Taylor\\x97a friend of Herrick\\'s and an antique aircraft enthusiast in his own right\\x97submitted a FOIA request seeking the same documents Herrick had unsuccessfully sued to obtain.\\nWhen the FAA failed to respond, Taylor filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\\nLike Herrick, Taylor argued that FEAC\\'s 1955 letter had stripped the records of their trade-secret status.\\nBut Taylor also sought to litigate the two issues concerning recapture of protected status that Herrick had failed to raise in his appeal to the Tenth Circuit.\\nAfter Fairchild intervened as a defendant, [1] *2169 the District Court in D.C. concluded that Taylor\\'s suit was barred by claim preclusion;\\naccordingly, it granted summary judgment to Fairchild and the FAA.\\nThe court acknowledged that Taylor was not a party to Herrick\\'s suit.\\nRelying on the Eighth Circuit\\'s decision in Tyus v. Schoemehl, 93 F.3d 449 (1996), however, it held that a nonparty may be bound by a judgment if she was \"virtually represented\" by a party.\\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 30a-31a.\\nThe Eighth Circuit\\'s seven-factor test for virtual representation, adopted by the District Court in Taylor\\'s case, requires an \"identity of interests\" between the person to be bound and a party to the judgment.\\nSee id., at 31a. See also Tyus, 93 F.3d, at 455.\\nSix additional factors counsel in favor of virtual representation under the Eighth Circuit\\'s test, but are not prerequisites: (1) a \"close relationship\" between the present party and a party to the judgment alleged to be preclusive; (2) \"participation in the prior litigation\" by the present party; (3) the present party\\'s \"apparent acquiescence\" to the preclusive effect of the judgment; (4) \"deliberat[e] maneuver[ing]\" to avoid the effect of the judgment; (5) adequate representation of the present party by a party to the prior adjudication; and (6) a suit raising a \"public law\" rather than a \"private law\" issue. App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a (citing Tyus, 93 F.3d, at 454-456).\\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 31a (citing Tyus, 93 F.3d, at 454-456).\\nThese factors, the D.C. District Court observed, \"constitute a fluid test with imprecise boundaries\" and call for \"a broad, case-by-case inquiry.\"\\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 32a.\\nThe record before the District Court in Taylor\\'s suit revealed the following facts about the relationship between Taylor and Herrick:\\nTaylor is the president of the Antique Aircraft Association, an organization to which Herrick belongs;\\nthe two men are \"close associate[s],\" App. 54;\\nHerrick asked Taylor to help restore Herrick\\'s F-45, though they had no contract or agreement for Taylor\\'s participation in the restoration;\\nTaylor was represented by the lawyer who represented Herrick in the earlier litigation;\\nand Herrick apparently gave Taylor documents that Herrick had obtained from the FAA during discovery in his suit.\\nFairchild and the FAA conceded that Taylor had not participated in Herrick\\'s suit.\\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 32a.\\nThe D.C. District Court determined, however, that Herrick ranked as Taylor\\'s virtual representative because the facts fit each of the other six indicators on the Eighth Circuit\\'s list.\\nSee id., at 32a-35a.\\nAccordingly, the District Court held Taylor\\'s suit, seeking the same documents Herrick had requested, barred by the judgment against Herrick.\\nSee id., at 35a.\\nThe D.C. Circuit affirmed.\\nIt observed, first, that other Circuits \"vary widely\" in their approaches to virtual representation.\\nTaylor v. Blakey, 490 F.3d 965 , 971 (2007).\\nIn this regard, the D.C. Circuit contrasted the multifactor balancing test applied by the Eighth Circuit and the D.C. District Court with the Fourth Circuit\\'s narrower approach, which \"treats a party as a virtual representative only if the party is `accountable to the nonparties who file a subsequent suit\\' and has `the tacit approval of the court\\' to act on the nonpart[ies\\'] behalf.\"\\nIbid. (quoting Klugh v. United States, 818 F.2d 294 , 300 (C.A.4 1987)).\\nRejecting both of these approaches, the D.C. Circuit announced its own five-factor *2170 test.\\nThe first two factors\\x97\"identity of interests\" and \"adequate representation\"\\x97 are necessary but not sufficient for virtual representation.\\n490 F.3d, at 971-972.\\nIn addition, at least one of three other factors must be established: \"a close relationship between the present party and his putative representative,\" \"substantial participation by the present party in the first case,\" or \"tactical maneuvering on the part of the present party to avoid preclusion by the prior judgment.\"\\nId., at 972.\\nApplying this test to the record in Taylor\\'s case, the D.C. Circuit found both of the necessary conditions for virtual representation well met.\\nAs to identity of interests, the court emphasized that Taylor and Herrick sought the same result\\x97release of the F-45 documents.\\nMoreover, the D.C. Circuit observed, Herrick owned an F-45 airplane, and therefore had \"if anything, a stronger incentive to litigate\" than Taylor, who had only a \"general interest in public disclosure and the preservation of antique aircraft heritage.\"\\nId., at 973 (internal quotation marks omitted).\\nTurning to adequacy of representation, the D.C. Circuit acknowledged that some other Circuits regard notice of a prior suit as essential to a determination that a nonparty was adequately represented in that suit.\\nSee id., at 973-974 (citing Perez v. Volvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d 303 , 312 (C.A.1 2001), and Tice v. American Airlines, Inc., 162 F.3d 966, 973 (C.A.7 1998)).\\nDisagreeing with these courts, the D.C. Circuit deemed notice an \"important\" but not an indispensable element in the adequacy inquiry.\\nThe court then concluded that Herrick had adequately represented Taylor even though Taylor had received no notice of Herrick\\'s suit.\\nFor this conclusion, the appeals court relied on Herrick\\'s \"strong incentive to litigate\" and Taylor\\'s later engagement of the same attorney, which indicated to the court Taylor\\'s satisfaction with that attorney\\'s performance in Herrick\\'s case.\\nSee 490 F.3d, at 974-975.\\nThe D.C. Circuit also found its \"close relationship\" criterion met, for Herrick had \"asked Taylor to assist him in restoring his F-45\" and \"provided information to Taylor that Herrick had obtained through discovery\";\\nfurthermore, Taylor \"did not oppose Fairchild\\'s characterization of Herrick as his `close associate.\\'\"\\nId., at 975.\\nBecause the three above-described factors sufficed to establish virtual representation under the D.C. Circuit\\'s five-factor test, the appeals court left open the question whether Taylor had engaged in \"tactical maneuvering.\"\\nSee id., at 976 (calling the facts bearing on tactical maneuvering \"ambigu[ous]\").

Ed. 2d 76 (1996).\\nTaylor\\'s case presents an issue of first impression in this sense:\\nUntil now, we have never addressed the doctrine of \"virtual representation\" adopted (in varying forms) by several Circuits and relied upon by the courts below.\\nOur inquiry, however, is guided by well-established precedent regarding the propriety of nonparty preclusion.\\nWe review that precedent before taking up directly the issue of virtual representation.\\nThe preclusive effect of a judgment is defined by claim preclusion and issue preclusion, which are collectively referred to as \"res judicata.\" [5]\\nUnder the doctrine of claim preclusion, a final judgment forecloses \"successive litigation of the very same claim, whether or not relitigation of the claim raises the same issues as the earlier suit.\"\\nNew Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742 , 748, 121 S. Ct. 1808 , 149 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2001).\\nIssue preclusion, in contrast, bars \"successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment,\" even if the issue recurs in the context of a different claim.\\nId., at 748-749, 121 S. Ct. 1808 .\\nBy \"preclud[ing] parties from contesting matters that they have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate,\" these two doctrines protect against \"the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserv[e] judicial resources, and foste[r] reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.\"\\nMontana v.

Ed. 2d 210 (1979).\\nA person who was not a party to a suit generally has not had a \"full and fair opportunity to litigate\" the claims and issues settled in that suit.\\nThe application of claim and issue preclusion to nonparties thus runs up against the \"deep-rooted historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court.\"\\nRichards, 517 U.S., at 798, 116 S. Ct. 1761 (internal quotation marks omitted).\\nIndicating the strength of that tradition, we have often repeated the general rule that \"one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process.\"\\nHansberry, 311 U.S., at 40, 61 S.

[6]\\nFirst, \"[a] person who agrees to be bound by the determination of issues in an action between others is bound in accordance with the terms of his agreement.\" 1\\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments § 40, p. 390 (1980) (hereinafter Restatement).\\nFor example, \"if separate actions involving the same transaction are brought by different plaintiffs against the same defendant, all the parties to all the actions may agree that the question of the defendant\\'s liability will be definitely determined, one way or the other, in a `test case.\\'\"\\nD. Shapiro, Civil Procedure: Preclusion in Civil Actions 77-78 (2001) (hereinafter Shapiro).\\nSee also California v. Texas, 459 U.S. 1096, 1097, 103 S. Ct. 714, 74 L. Ed. 2d 944 (1983) (dismissing certain defendants from a suit based on a stipulation \"that each of said defendants . . . will be bound by a final judgment of this Court\" on a specified issue).\\nSecond, nonparty preclusion may be justified based on a variety of pre-existing \"substantive legal relationship[s]\" between the person to be bound and a party to the judgment.\\nShapiro 78.\\nSee also Richards, 517 U.S., at 798, 116 S. Ct. 1761 .\\nQualifying relationships include, but are not limited to, preceding and succeeding owners of property, bailee and bailor, and assignee and assignor.\\nSee 2 Restatement §§ 43-44, 52, 55.\\nThese exceptions originated \"as much from the needs of property law as from the values of preclusion by judgment.\"\\n18A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\\nThird, we have confirmed that, \"in certain limited circumstances,\" a nonparty may be bound by a judgment because she was \"adequately represented by someone with the same interests who [wa]s a party\" to the suit.\\nRichards, 517 U.S., at 798, 116 S. Ct. 1761 (internal quotation marks omitted).\\nRepresentative suits with preclusive effect on nonparties include properly conducted class actions, see Martin, 490 U.S., at 762, n. 2, 109 S. Ct. 2180 (citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23), and suits brought by *2173 trustees, guardians, and other fiduciaries, see Sea-Land Services, Inc. v. Gaudet, 414 U.S. 573 , 593, 94 S. Ct. 806 , 39 L. Ed. 2d 9 (1974).\\nSee also 1 Restatement § 41.\\nFourth, a nonparty is bound by a judgment if she \"assume[d] control\" over the litigation in which that judgment was rendered.\\nMontana, 440 U.S., at 154, 99 S.

Co. v. Schendel, 270 U.S. 611 , 620, 623, 46 S. Ct. 420 , 70 L. Ed. 757 (1926); 18A Wright & Miller § 4454, pp. 433-434.\\nAnd although our decisions have not addressed the issue directly, it also seems clear that preclusion is appropriate when a nonparty later brings suit as an agent for a party who is bound by a judgment.\\nSee id., § 4449, p. 335.\\nSixth, in certain circumstances a special statutory scheme may \"expressly foreclos[e] successive litigation by nonlitigants. . . if the scheme is otherwise consistent with due process.\"\\nMartin, 490 U.S., at 762, n. 2, 109 S. Ct. 2180 .\\nExamples of such schemes include bankruptcy and probate proceedings, see ibid., and quo warranto actions or other suits that, \"under [the governing] law, [may] be brought only on behalf of the public at large,\"\\nRichards, 517 U.S., at 804, 116 S. Ct. 1761 .\\nReaching beyond these six established categories, some lower courts have recognized a \"virtual representation\" exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion.\\nDecisions of these courts, however, have been far from consistent.\\nSee 18A Wright & Miller § 4457, p. 513 (virtual representation lacks a \"clear or coherent theory\"; decisions applying it have \"an episodic quality\").\\nSome Circuits use the label, but define \"virtual representation\" so that it is no broader than the recognized exception for adequate representation.\\nSee, e.g., Becherer v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 193 F.3d 415 , 423, 427 (C.A.6 1999).\\nBut other courts, including the Eighth, Ninth, and D.C. Circuits, apply multifactor tests for virtual representation that permit nonparty preclusion in cases that do not fit within any of the established exceptions.\\nSee supra, at 2168-2170, and n. 3.\\nThe D.C. Circuit, the FAA, and Fairchild have presented three arguments in support of an expansive doctrine of virtual representation.\\nWe find none of them persuasive.\\nThe D.C. Circuit purported to ground its virtual representation doctrine in this Court\\'s decisions stating that, in some circumstances, a person may be bound by a judgment if she was adequately represented by a party to the proceeding yielding that judgment.\\nSee 490 F.3d, at 970-971.\\nBut the D.C. Circuit\\'s definition of \"adequate representation\" strayed from the meaning our decisions have attributed to that term.\\nIn Richards, we reviewed a decision by the Alabama Supreme Court holding that a challenge to a tax was barred by a judgment upholding the same tax in a suit *2174 filed by different taxpayers.\\n517 U.S., at 795-797, 116 S. Ct. 1761 .\\nThe plaintiffs in the first suit \"did not sue on behalf of a class,\" their complaint \"did not purport to assert any claim against or on behalf of any nonparties,\" and the judgment \"did not purport to bind\" nonparties.\\nId., at 801, 116 S. Ct. 1761 .\\nThere was no indication, we emphasized, that the court in the first suit \"took care to protect the interests\" of absent parties, or that the parties to that litigation \"understood their suit to be on behalf of absent [parties].\"\\nId., at 802, 116 S. Ct. 1761 .\\nIn these circumstances, we held, the application of claim preclusion was inconsistent with \"the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\\nId., at 797, 116 S. Ct. 1761 .\\nThe D.C. Circuit stated, without elaboration, that it did not \"read Richards to hold a nonparty . . . adequately represented only if special procedures were followed [to protect the nonparty] or the party to the prior suit understood it was representing the nonparty.\"\\n490 F.3d, at 971 .\\nAs the D.C. Circuit saw this case, Herrick adequately represented Taylor for two principal reasons:\\nHerrick had a strong incentive to litigate;\\nand Taylor later hired Herrick\\'s lawyer, suggesting Taylor\\'s \"satisfaction with the attorney\\'s performance in the prior case.\"\\nId., at 975.\\nThe D.C. Circuit misapprehended Richards.\\nAs just recounted, our holding that the Alabama Supreme Court\\'s application of res judicata to nonparties violated due process turned on the lack of either special procedures to protect the nonparties\\' interests or an understanding by the concerned parties that the first suit was brought in a representative capacity.\\nSee Richards, 517 U.S., at 801-802, 116 S. Ct. 1761 .\\nRichards thus established that representation is \"adequate\" for purposes of nonparty preclusion only if (at a minimum) one of these two circumstances is present.\\nWe restated Richards\\' core holding in South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U.S. 160 , 119 S. Ct. 1180 , 143 L. Ed. 2d 258 (1999).\\nIn that case, as in Richards, the Alabama courts had held that a judgment rejecting a challenge to a tax by one group of taxpayers barred a subsequent suit by a different taxpayer.\\nSee 526 U.S., at 164-165, 119 S. Ct. 1180 .\\nIn South Central Bell, however, the nonparty had notice of the original suit and engaged one of the lawyers earlier employed by the original plaintiffs.\\nSee id., at 167-168, 119 S. Ct. 1180 .\\nUnder the D.C. Circuit\\'s decision in Taylor\\'s case, these factors apparently would have sufficed to establish adequate representation.\\nSee 490 F.3d, at 973-975.\\nYet South Central Bell held that the application of res judicata in that case violated due process.\\nOur inquiry came to an end when we determined that the original plaintiffs had not understood themselves to be acting in a representative capacity and that there had been no special procedures to safeguard the interests of absentees.\\nSee 526 U.S., at 168 , 119 S. Ct. 1180 .\\nOur decisions recognizing that a nonparty may be bound by a judgment if she was adequately represented by a party to the earlier suit thus provide no support for the D.C. Circuit\\'s broad theory of virtual representation.\\nFairchild and the FAA do not argue that the D.C. Circuit\\'s virtual representation doctrine fits within any of the recognized grounds for nonparty preclusion.\\nRather, they ask us to abandon the attempt to delineate discrete grounds and clear rules altogether.\\nPreclusion is in order, they contend, whenever \"the relationship between a party and a non-party *2175 is `close enough\\' to bring the second litigant within the judgment.\"\\nBrief for Respondent Fairchild 20.\\nSee also Brief for Respondent FAA 22-24.\\nCourts should make the \"close enough\" determination, they urge, through a \"heavily fact-driven\" and \"equitable\" inquiry.\\nBrief for Respondent Fairchild 20.\\nSee also Brief for Respondent FAA 22 (\"there is no clear test\" for nonparty preclusion; rather, an \"equitable and fact-intensive\" inquiry is demanded (internal quotation marks omitted)).\\nOnly this sort of diffuse balancing, Fairchild and the FAA argue, can account for all of the situations in which nonparty preclusion is appropriate.\\nWe reject this argument for three reasons.\\nFirst, our decisions emphasize the fundamental nature of the general rule that a litigant is not bound by a judgment to which she was not a party\\nSee, e.g., Richards, 517 U.S., at 798-799, 116 S. Ct. 1761 ; Martin, 490 U.S., at 761-762, 109 S. Ct. 2180 .\\nMartin, 490 U.S., at 761-762, 109 S. Ct. 2180 .\\nAccordingly, we have endeavored to delineate discrete exceptions that apply in \"limited circumstances.\"\\nId., at 762, n. 2, 109 S. Ct. 2180 .\\nRespondents\\' amorphous balancing test is at odds with the constrained approach to nonparty preclusion our decisions advance.\\nResisting this reading of our precedents, respondents call up three decisions they view as supportive of the approach they espouse.\\nFairchild quotes our statement in Coryell v. Phipps, 317 U.S. 406 , 411, 63 S. Ct. 291 , 87 L. Ed. 363 (1943), that privity \"turns on the facts of particular cases.\"\\nSee Brief for Respondent Fairchild 20.\\nThat observation, however, scarcely implies that privity is governed by a diffuse balancing test. [9]\\nFairchild also cites Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Ill. Foundation, 402 U.S. 313 , 334, 91 S. Ct. 1434 , 28 L. Ed. 2d 788 (1971), which stated that estoppel questions turn on \"the trial courts\\' sense of justice and equity.\"\\nSee Brief for Respondent Fairchild 20.\\nThis passing statement, however, was not made with nonparty preclusion in mind;\\nit appeared in a discussion recognizing district courts\\' discretion to limit the use of issue preclusion against persons who were parties to a judgment.\\nSee Blonder-Tongue, 402 U.S., at 334, 91 S. Ct. 1434 .\\nThe FAA relies on United States v. Des Moines Valley R. Co., 84 F. 40 (C.A.8 1897), an opinion we quoted with approval in Schendel, 270 U.S., at 619-620, 46 S. Ct. 420 .\\nDes Moines Valley was a quiet title action in which the named plaintiff was the United States.\\nThe Government, however, had \"no interest in the land\" and had \"simply permitted [the landowner] to use its name as the nominal plaintiff.\"\\n84 F., at 42.\\nThe suit was therefore barred, the appeals court held, by an earlier judgment against the landowner.\\nAs the court explained: \"[W]here the government lends its name as a plaintiff . . . to enable one private person to maintain a suit against another,\" the government is \"subject to the same defenses which exist . . . against the real party in interest.\"\\nId., at 43.\\nDes Moines Valley, the FAA contended at oral argument, demonstrates that it is sometimes appropriate to bind a nonparty in circumstances that do not fit within any of the established grounds for nonparty preclusion.\\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 31-33.\\nProperly understood, however, Des Moines Valley is simply an application of the fifth basis for nonparty preclusion described above:\\nA party may not use a *2176 representative or agent to relitigate an adverse judgment.\\nSee supra, at 2172-2173. [10\\nWe thus find no support in our precedents for the lax approach to nonparty preclusion advocated by respondents.\\nOur second reason for rejecting a broad doctrine of virtual representation rests on the limitations attending nonparty preclusion based on adequate representation.\\nA party\\'s representation of a nonparty is \"adequate\" for preclusion purposes only if, at a minimum: (1) the interests of the nonparty and her representative are aligned, see Hansberry, 311 U.S., at 43, 61 S. Ct. 115 ;\\n1) the interests of the nonparty and her representative are aligned, see Hansberry, 311 U.S., at 43, 61 S. Ct. 115\\nand (2) either the party understood herself to be acting in a representative capacity or the original court took care to protect the interests of the nonparty, see Richards, 517 U.S., at 801-802, 116 S. Ct. 1761 ; supra, at 2173-2174.\\nIn addition, adequate representation sometimes requires (3) notice of the original suit to the persons alleged to have been represented,\\nsee Richards, 517 U.S., at 801, 116 S. Ct. 1761 . [11]\\nIn the class-action context, these limitations are implemented by the procedural safeguards contained in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.\\nAn expansive doctrine of virtual representation, however, would \"recogniz[e], in effect, a common-law kind of class action.\"\\nTice, 162 F.3d, at 972 (internal quotation marks omitted).\\nThat is, virtual representation would authorize preclusion based on identity of interests and some kind of relationship between parties and nonparties, shorn of the procedural protections prescribed in Hansberry, Richards, and Rule 23.\\nThese protections, grounded in due process, could be circumvented were we to approve a virtual representation doctrine that allowed courts to \"create de facto class actions at will.\"\\nTice, 162 F.3d, at 973.\\nThird, a diffuse balancing approach to nonparty preclusion would likely create more headaches than it relieves.\\nMost obviously, it could significantly complicate the task of district courts faced in the first instance with preclusion questions.\\nAn all-things-considered balancing approach might spark wide-ranging, time-consuming, and expensive discovery tracking factors potentially relevant under seven- or five-prong tests.\\nAnd after the relevant facts are established, district judges would be called upon to evaluate them under a standard that provides no firm guidance.\\nSee Tyus, 93 F.3d, at 455 (conceding that \"there is no clear test for determining the applicability of\" the virtual representation doctrine announced in that case).\\nSee Tyus, 93 F.3d, at 455 (conceding that \"there is no clear test for determining the applicability of\" the virtual representation doctrine announced in that case).\\nPreclusion doctrine, it should be recalled, is intended *2177 to reduce the burden of litigation on courts and parties.\\nCf. Montana, 440 U.S., at 153-154, 99 S. Ct. 970 .\\n\"In this area of the law,\" we agree, \"`crisp rules with sharp corners\\' are preferable to a round-about doctrine of opaque standards.\"\\nBittinger v. Tecumseh Products Co., 123 F.3d 877 , 881 (C.A.6 1997).\\nFinally, relying on the Eighth Circuit\\'s decision in Tyus, 93 F.3d, at 456, the FAA maintains that nonparty preclusion should apply more broadly in \"public-law\" litigation than in \"private-law\" controversies.\\nTo support this position, the FAA offers two arguments.\\nFirst, the FAA urges, our decision in Richards acknowledges that, in certain cases, the plaintiff has a reduced interest in controlling the litigation \"because of the public nature of the right at issue.\"\\nBrief for Respondent FAA 28.\\nWhen a taxpayer challenges \"an alleged misuse of public funds\" or \"other public action,\" we observed in Richards, the suit \"has only an indirect impact on [the plaintiff\\'s] interests.\"\\n517 U.S., at 803 , 116 S. Ct. 1761 .\\nIn actions of this character, the Court said, \"we may assume that the States have wide latitude to establish procedures . . . to limit the number of judicial proceedings that may be entertained.\"\\nIbid.\\nTaylor\\'s FOIA action falls within the category described in Richards, the FAA contends, because \"the duty to disclose under FOIA is owed to the public generally.\"\\nSee Brief for Respondent FAA 34.\\nThe opening sentence of FOIA, it is true, states that agencies \"shall make [information] available to the public.\"\\n5 U.S.C. § 552(a) (2006 ed.).\\nEqually true, we have several times said that FOIA vindicates a \"public\" interest.\\nE.g., National Archives and Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 , 172, 124 S. Ct. 1570 , 158 L. Ed. 2d 319 (2004).\\nThe Act, however, instructs agencies receiving FOIA requests to make the information available not to the public at large, but rather to the \"person\" making the request.\\n§ 552(a)(3)(A).\\nSee also § 552(a)(3)(B) (\"In making any record available to a person under this paragraph, an agency shall provide the record in any [readily reproducible] form or format requested by the person . . . .\" (emphasis added));\\nBrief for National Security Archive et al. as Amici Curiae 10 (\"Government agencies do not systematically make released records available to the general public.\").\\nThus, in contrast to the public-law litigation contemplated in Richards, a successful FOIA action results in a grant of relief to the individual plaintiff, not a decree benefiting the public at large.\\nFurthermore, we said in Richards only that, for the type of public-law claims there envisioned, States are free to adopt procedures limiting repetitive litigation.\\nSee 517 U.S., at 803 , 116 S. Ct. 1761 .\\nIn this regard, we referred to instances in which the first judgment foreclosed successive litigation by other plaintiffs because, \"under state law, [the suit] could be brought only on behalf of the public at large.\"\\nId., at 804, 116 S. Ct. 1761 . [12]\\nRichards spoke of state legislation, but it appears equally evident that Congress, in providing for actions vindicating a public interest, may \"limit the number of judicial proceedings that may be entertained.\"\\nId., at 803, 116 S. Ct. 1761 .\\nIt hardly follows, however, that this Court should proscribe or confine successive FOIA suits by different requesters.\\nIndeed, Congress\\' provision for FOIA suits with no statutory constraint on successive actions counsels against judicial imposition of constraints *2178 through extraordinary application of the common law of preclusion.\\nThe FAA next argues that \"the threat of vexatious litigation is heightened\" in public-law cases because \"the number of plaintiffs with standing is potentially limitless.\"\\nBrief for Respondent FAA 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).\\nFOIA does allow \"any person\" whose request is denied to resort to federal court for review of the agency\\'s determination.\\n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A), (4)(B) (2006 ed.).\\nThus it is theoretically possible that several persons could coordinate to mount a series of repetitive lawsuits.\\nBut we are not convinced that this risk justifies departure from the usual rules governing nonparty preclusion.\\nFirst, stare decisis will allow courts swiftly to dispose of repetitive suits brought in the same circuit.\\nSecond, even when stare decisis is not dispositive, \"the human tendency not to waste money will deter the bringing of suits based on claims or issues that have already been adversely determined against others.\"\\nShapiro 97.\\nThis intuition seems to be borne out by experience:\\nThe FAA has not called our attention to any instances of abusive FOIA suits in the Circuits that reject the virtual-representation theory respondents advocate here.\\nFor the foregoing reasons, we disapprove the theory of virtual representation on which the decision below rested.\\nThe preclusive effects of a judgment in a federal-question case decided by a federal court should instead be determined according to the established grounds for nonparty preclusion described in this opinion.\\nSee Part II-B, supra.\\nAlthough references to \"virtual representation\" have proliferated in the lower courts, our decision is unlikely to occasion any great shift in actual practice.\\nMany opinions use the term \"virtual representation\" in reaching results at least arguably defensible on established grounds.\\nSee 18A Wright & Miller § 4457, pp. 535-539, and n. 38 (collecting cases).\\nIn these cases, dropping the \"virtual representation\" label would lead to clearer analysis with little, if any, change in outcomes.\\nSee Tice, 162 F.3d, at 971.\\n(\"[T]he term `virtual representation\\' has cast more shadows than light on the problem [of nonparty preclusion].\").\\nIn some cases, however, lower courts have relied on virtual representation to extend nonparty preclusion beyond the latter doctrine\\'s proper bounds.\\nWe now turn back to Taylor\\'s action to determine whether his suit is such a case, or whether the result reached by the courts below can be justified on one of the recognized grounds for nonparty preclusion.\\nIt is uncontested that four of the six grounds for nonparty preclusion have no application here:\\nThere is no indication that Taylor agreed to be bound by Herrick\\'s litigation, that Taylor and Herrick have any legal relationship, that Taylor exercised any control over Herrick\\'s suit, or that this suit implicates any special statutory scheme limiting relitigation.\\nNeither the FAA nor Fairchild contends otherwise.\\nIt is equally clear that preclusion cannot be justified on the theory that Taylor was adequately represented in Herrick\\'s suit.\\nNothing in the record indicates that Herrick understood himself to be suing on Taylor\\'s behalf, that Taylor even knew of Herrick\\'s suit, or that the Wyoming District Court took special care to protect Taylor\\'s interests.\\nUnder our pathmarking precedent, therefore, Herrick\\'s representation *2179 was not \"adequate.\"\\nSee Richards, 517 U.S., at 801-802, 116 S. Ct. 1761 .\\nThat leaves only the fifth category: preclusion because a nonparty to an earlier litigation has brought suit as a representative or agent of a party who is bound by the prior adjudication.\\nTaylor is not Herrick\\'s legal representative and he has not purported to sue in a representative capacity.\\nHe concedes, however, that preclusion would be appropriate if respondents could demonstrate that he is acting as Herrick\\'s \"undisclosed agen[t].\"\\nBrief for Petitioner 23, n. 4.\\nSee also id., at 24, n. 5.\\nRespondents argue here, as they did below, that Taylor\\'s suit is a collusive attempt to relitigate Herrick\\'s action.\\nSee Brief for Respondent Fairchild 32,\\nand n. 18; Brief for Respondent FAA 18-19, 33, 39.\\nThe D.C. Circuit considered a similar question in addressing the \"tactical maneuvering\" prong of its virtual representation test.\\nSee 490 F.3d, at 976 .\\nThe Court of Appeals did not, however, treat the issue as one of agency, and it expressly declined to reach any definitive conclusions due to \"the ambiguity of the facts.\"\\nIbid.\\nWe therefore remand to give the courts below an opportunity to determine whether Taylor, in pursuing the instant FOIA suit, is acting as Herrick\\'s agent.\\nTaylor concedes that such a remand is appropriate.\\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 56-57.\\nWe have never defined the showing required to establish that a nonparty to a prior adjudication has become a litigating agent for a party to the earlier case.\\nBecause the issue has not been briefed in any detail, we do not discuss the matter elaboratively here.\\nWe note, however, that courts should be cautious about finding preclusion on this basis.\\nA mere whiff of \"tactical maneuvering\" will not suffice;\\ninstead, principles of agency law are suggestive.\\nThey indicate that preclusion is appropriate only if the putative agent\\'s conduct of the suit is subject to the control of the party who is bound by the prior adjudication.\\nSee 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency § 14, p. 60 (1957)\\n(\"A principal has the right to control the conduct of the agent with respect to matters entrusted to him.\").\\nOn remand, Fairchild suggests, Taylor should bear the burden of proving he is not acting as Herrick\\'s agent.\\nWhen a defendant points to evidence establishing a close relationship between successive litigants, Fairchild maintains, \"the burden [should] shif[t] to the second litigant to submit evidence refuting the charge\" of agency.\\nBrief for Respondent Fairchild 27-28.\\nFairchild justifies this proposed burden-shift on the ground that \"it is unlikely an opposing party will have access to direct evidence of collusion.\"\\nId., at 28, n. 14.\\nWe reject Fairchild\\'s suggestion.\\nClaim preclusion, like issue preclusion, is an affirmative defense.\\nSee Fed.

Ed. 2d 798 (2007)\\nand we have never recognized claim preclusion as an exception to that general rule,\\nsee 18 Wright & Miller § 4405, p. 83\\n(\"[A] party asserting preclusion must carry the burden of establishing all necessary elements.\")\\nWe acknowledge that direct evidence justifying nonparty preclusion is often in the hands of plaintiffs rather than defendants.\\n.

Broun, McCormick on Evidence § 337, p. 475 (6th ed.2006).\\nIn these situations, targeted interrogatories or deposition questions can reduce the information disparity.\\nWe see no greater cause here than in other matters of affirmative defense to disturb the traditional allocation of the proof burden.\\nFor the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\nIt is so ordered.\\n', 'MR.

(hereinafter taxpayers) instituted this action for a tax refund in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi\\nBoth taxpayers are \"cooperative associations\" within the meaning of § 15 of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 46 Stat. 18, as amended, 12 U.S. C. § 1141j, and thus qualify for membership in one of the 12 \"Banks for Cooperatives\" (hereinafter Bank(s)) established by the Farm Credit Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 257, as amended, 12 U.S. C. § 1134 et seq.\\nSince their principal places of business are located in Mississippi, their regional Bank is the one located in New Orleans.\\nThe Farm Credit Act of 1933 provides that members may borrow money from their Banks\\nand, soon after securing membership in the New Orleans Bank, the taxpayers elected to borrow. [1]\\nThereafter, they were required by the Farm Credit Act of 1955, 69 Stat. 656, 12 U.S. C. § 1134d (a)(3), which partially amended the 1933 Act, to make quarterly purchases of $100 par value Class C stock of the Bank equal to not less than 10% nor more than 25% of the amount of the quarterly interest that they paid to the Bank on *300 their loans.\\nDuring the period relevant to this lawsuit, the rate set by the Bank was 15%. [\\nOn their tax returns for the years in question, the taxpayers claimed a $99 interest expense deduction for every $100 stock purchase required by the statute. [3]\\nThe Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deductions, the taxpayers paid the assessed deficiencies,\\nand this action arose.\\nThe United States has consistently contended that the stock that the taxpayers were required to purchase under the 1955 Act is a capital asset as defined by § 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S. C. § 1221, and that its cost is nondeductible.\\nSee 26 U.S. C. § 263.\\nThe taxpayers have persistently urged that the money expended for this stock is part of \"the amount [they] . . . contracted to pay for the use of borrowed money,\" Old Colony R. Co. v. Commissioner, 284 U.S. 552 , 560 (1932), and is deductible as interest. 26 U.S. C. § 163 (a).\\nThe District Court found for the taxpayers [4] and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed over the dissent of Judge Godbold.\\n431 F.2d 1320 (1970).\\nWe granted certiorari on February 22, 1971, to review the decision of the Court of Appeals.\\n401 U.S. 908.\\nWe reverse for the reasons stated below.\\nEarly in this century, Congress recognized that farmers had a tremendous need for long-term capital at low interest rates.\\nThis led to the enactment of the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 360, as amended, 12 U.S. C. § 641 et seq.\\nThe immediate purpose of the bill was \"to afford those who [were] engaged in farming or who desire[d] to engage in that occupation a vastly greater volume of land credit on more favorable terms and at materially lower and more nearly uniform interest rates than [were] present[ly] available.\"\\nH. R. Rep. No. 630, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., 2.\\nThe longrange purpose was to stimulate and foster a cooperative spirit among farmers who, it was hoped, would work together to seek agricultural improvements which they would finance themselves.\\nId., at 2-3; S. Rep. No. 144, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., 5.\\nThe 1916 Act divided the United States into 12 regional districts under the general supervision of a Federal Farm Loan Board.\\nEach district contained a federal land bank designed to loan money to farmers at low interest rates.\\nPersons desiring to borrow were required to organize into groups of 10 or more which were called \"national farm loan associations.\"\\nSec. 7, 39 Stat. 365.\\nIn order to borrow from the district bank, an association had to establish that each of its members was an owner or a prospective owner of a farm, that the loan desired by each member was not less than $100 nor more than $10,000, and that the aggregate of the loans was not less than $20,000.\\nEach association also had to subscribe for capital stock of the bank in the amount of 5% of the total loan sought by its members.\\nThe *302 association, in turn, was required to compel each of its members to purchase stock in the association equal to 5% of the amount of the loan sought by that member.\\nHence, there were two separate levels of cooperative association. [5]\\nThe legislative history and the language of the Act itself indicate that Congress faced somewhat of a dilemma in structuring the land bank system.\\nOn the one hand, there was a strong congressional desire to stimulate a privately controlled, privately owned, and privately financed program based upon the cooperative efforts of dedicated farmers.\\nThis desire was effectuated in large measure in the stock-purchase requirements discussed above.\\nOn the other hand, Congress realized that without federal help, the existing plight of the farmers would probably render them unable to support the system themselves, and it would thus be doomed to failure:\\n\"The greatest difficulty in the establishment of a rural-credit system, based upon the cooperative principle, is met in connection with the inauguration of the system. Ample capital is absolutely necessary at the start and whatever sums the first borrowers might be able to contribute would in no wise suffice to get the system into successful operation. The system must be endowed, temporarily at least, with capital from sources other than the subscriptions to capital stock among the borrowers.\"\\nH. R. Rep. No. 630, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., 9.\\nAccord, S. Rep. No. 144, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., 4.\\nTo resolve the dilemma, Congress provided for temporary public financing without charge to supplement the stock-purchase requirements of the statute.\\nCongress also provided that each land bank must periodically increase its capital shares in order to achieve the goal of private ownership of the system, and to repay the temporary federal financing.\\nThe land bank system remained virtually untouched [6] until the economic depression of the 1930\\'s when Congress determined that more action was needed to aid farmers in establishing privately owned institutions designed to provide ready sources of long-term credit.\\nThe Farm Credit Act of 1933 was passed to supplement the 1916 legislation.\\nIt established, inter alia, regional Banks for Cooperatives in each of the 12 land bank districts and a Central Bank for Cooperatives in Washington, D. C. [7]\\nThese Banks were authorized to make loans to \"cooperative associations,\" defined as \"association[s] in which farmers act together in processing, preparing for market, handling, and/or marketing the farm products of persons so engaged, and also . . . association[s] in which farmers act together in purchasing, testing, grading, processing, distributing, and/or furnishing farm supplies and/or farm business services.\"\\nAgricultural Marketing Act § 15, 46 Stat. 18, as amended, 12 U.S. C. § 1141j.\\nThe new Banks paralleled in many ways those already established under the 1916 legislation.\\nThe same regional *304 districts were used, many of the same persons were eligible for loans from both institutions, and borrowers from both banks were required to be stockholders.\\nThe 1933 Act required cooperative associations to own, at the time a loan was made, an amount of stock in the Bank for Cooperatives equal in fair book value (not to exceed par value) to $100 per $2,000 of the amount of the loan, or 5%, the same amount of stock required of borrowers from land banks under the 1916 Act.\\nOne notable difference between the 1916 and the 1933 Acts was that the latter did not regulate the membership of the cooperative association to any great degree.\\nFor example, members of cooperative associations did not have to own stock in the associations, only in the Banks; they did not have to borrow a minimum amount; and they did not have to be farm owners or prospective farm owners, but could be processors, handlers, testers, or marketers.\\nThis is in sharp contrast to the stringent requirements of the 1916 legislation.\\nAnother notable difference is that Congress invested substantially more money in the 1933 program ($110,000,000) than it had invested in the land banks ($9,000,000).\\nSee S. Rep. No. 1201, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 5, 7.\\nAs time passed, Congress watched the land bank system develop as planned.\\nThe temporary Government capitalization that had solidified the program in its inception was gradually replaced by private capital, and by the end of 1947, the Government\\'s capital had been completely returned.\\nS. Doc. No. 7, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 4; S. Rep. No. 1201, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 7.\\nThe land banks became totally private concerns \\x97owned, operated, and financed by farmers without Government assistance.\\nCongress also watched the development of the Banks for Cooperatives and became concerned about their lack *305 of success in attracting and keeping private investment.\\nBy the 1950\\'s, the Government still retained over 88% of the stock in the Banks.\\nIn § 2 of the Farm Credit Act of 1953, 67 Stat. 390, 12 U.S. C. § 636a, Congress stated that \"[i]t is declared to be the policy of the Congress to encourage and facilitate increased borrower participation in the management, control, and ultimate ownership of the permanent system of agricultural credit made available through institutions operating under the supervision of the Farm Credit Administration . . . .\"\\nA Federal Farm Credit Board was created for the purpose, inter alia, of making recommendations concerning the best way to convert the Banks for Cooperatives from predominantly Government-owned to predominantly privately owned institutions.\\nThe result of the Board\\'s report and recommendations was the Farm Credit Act of 1955, 69 Stat. 655.\\nIt sought to effectuate Congress\\' policy by providing for the orderly withdrawal of Government capital from the Banks and the continual influx and retention of substitute private financing.\\nSee S. Doc. No. 7, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 6; S. Rep. No. 1201, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 1; Hearings on Farm Credit Act of 1955 before the House Committee on Agriculture, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 30-31.\\nUnder the Farm Credit Act of 1933, there was only one class of capital stock in the Banks for Cooperatives.\\nThe Farm Credit Act of 1955 provided for three distinct classes of stock\\x97A, B, and C.\\nClass A stock may only be held by the Governor of the Farm Credit Association on behalf of the United States.\\nWhatever stock the Government held in the Banks prior to the 1955 Act was converted to Class A stock.\\nThis stock is nonvoting and receives no dividends.\\n306 Class A stock must be retired each year in an amount equal to the amount of Class C stock issued during the year.\\n12 U.S. C. § 1134d (a) (1).\\nOnce the United States\\' stock is completely redeemed, the Government will invest no more in the Banks, except that it may purchase additional shares of the Class A stock if an emergency makes it necessary in order for the bank to meet the credit needs of eligible borrowers. [8]\\nSee 12 U.S. C. §§ 1134d (a) (1), 1134b, 1134i.\\nClass B stock represents a new approach to capitalizing the Banks.\\nIt is an investment stock available to the public.\\nIt pays noncumulative dividends upon certain conditions.\\nClass B stock may be retired only after all Class A stock.\\n12 U.S. C. § 1134d (a) (2). [9]\\nClass C stock may be issued only to farmers\\' cooperative associations, except that each regional bank is required to purchase such shares from the Central Bank.\\nThis stock may be obtained under four circumstances.\\nOne share is required to initially qualify any association as a borrower of a regional Bank.\\nEach borrower must then make the quarterly stock purchases which gave rise to this lawsuit.\\nIn addition, 12 U.S. C. § 1134l (b) provides that after certain expenditures are made each year, patronage refunds may be allocated to borrowers in the form of Class C stock.\\n\"All patronage refunds shall be paid in the proportion that the amount of interest earned on the loans of each *307 borrower bears to the total interest earned on the loans of all borrowers during the fiscal year.\"\\nIbid. [10]\\nBorrowers also receive at the end of each fiscal year an \"allocated surplus\" credit which is payable out of the Bank\\'s net savings.\\nLike patronage refunds, allocated surplus is credited to each member in accordance with the proportion that the interest on its loans bears to the interest on all loans.\\nWhen the surplus account reaches 25% of the total outstanding capital stock of the Bank, the excess may be distributed to members in the form of Class C stock.\\nOnly the tax treatment of the quarterly purchases is disputed here. [11]\\nThe taxpayers correctly note that the Class C stock has attributes which would make a normal commercial stock undesirable.\\nFor example, the C stock pays no dividends; [12] it is transferable *308 only between cooperatives and only under rare circumstances; additional shares do not provide additional voting power; [13] and the stock cannot be redeemed until all A, all B issued earlier or in the same year, and all earlier issued C shares have been called for redemption.\\nThese characteristics render the market for C shares virtually nonexistent.\\nIt must be remembered, however, that the stock was intentionally given these characteristics by a Congress with definite goals in mind. [14]\\nThe legislative history of the Farm Credit Act of 1955 indicates that Congress placed much of the blame for the Bank\\'s inability to *309 repay the capital extended by the Government and to retain private capital on the provision in the 1933 legislation which permitted borrowers to redeem their stock for cash upon paying off their loans.\\nThe restrictions on redemption and transferability and the dividend prohibition were designed to obviate this difficulty and to provide both a stable membership and permanent capital, two necessities for the success of any cooperative venture.\\nThe taxpayers do not seek to deduct the cost of their initial shares in the Bank as interest.\\nThey accept the fact that these shares represent one cost of membership and that this cost is a capital expense because membership is a valuable asset in more than one taxable year.\\nBut, they argue that once they purchased their initial shares, they obtained full membership rights, and, a fortiori, that Congress must have intended the quarterly expenditures for stock to be a charge for borrowing money since the stock has no value.\\nThe fact is, however, that the stock purchased quarterly is indeed valuable.\\nThe amounts paid for C shares become part of the permanent capital structure of the Bank, thereby increasing the stability of the Bank and insuring its continued ability to extend credit.\\nEach share also provides an opportunity for more patronage and surplus dividends, an ultimate right of redemption, and an asset that may be used as a set-off in case of a default on the loan.\\nIn sum, every share of stock purchased quarterly by the taxpayers is nearly as valuable as the shares purchased initially.\\nIt is therefore difficult to understand why these different purchases should receive radically different tax treatment.\\nIf Congress had required 1,000 or 100,000 shares of Class C stock to be purchased *310 before an association could borrow from the Banks, under the taxpayers\\' theory of the case the cost of those shares would be a nondeductible capital expense.\\nSimply because Congress eased the burden on farmers by spreading the requirement of capital investment over a period of time rather than requiring it as a prerequisite to borrowing, the taxpayers are entitled to no more favorable tax treatment.\\nIt is important not to lose sight of the congressional purposes in enacting the farm credit legislation.\\nThe immediate goal was to provide loans to farmers at low interest rates.\\nIt would, therefore, be odd for Congress to provide a \"hidden\" interest charge in the legislation.\\nThe long-range goal was to make the Banks \"fully cooperative and to place full ownership and responsibility for their operations and success in the hands of those eligible to borrow from them.\"\\nHearings on Farm Credit Act of 1955 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 60.\\nCongress felt, in light of its experience under the Farm Credit Act of 1933, that the long-range goal could only be achieved if Bank members made longterm investments in the Banks.\\nHence, Congress created Class C stock, a security with a special value in cooperative ventures.\\nWhile this security is sui generis, the congressional scheme makes it clear that it has value over the long run.\\nSince the security is of value in more than one taxable year, it is a capital asset within the meaning of § 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code, and its cost is nondeductible.\\nCf. Commissioner v. Lincoln Savings & Loan Assn., 403 U.S. 345 (1971); Old Colony R. Co. v. United States, 284 U.S. 552 (1932); 26 CFR § 1.461-1.\\nWe reject the contention that while the Class C *311 stock may be a capital asset, it is worth only $1, [15] and that the additional $99 paid for each share must represent interest.\\nWere we dealing with the traditional corporate structure in this case, the taxpayers\\' argument would have strength.\\nBut, as we have pointed out previously, the essential nature of cooperatives and corporations differs.\\nThe value of the Class C stock derives primarily from attributes other than marketability.\\nThe stock has value because it is the foundation of the cooperative scheme; it insures stability and continuity.\\nThe stock also has value because it enables the farmers to work together toward common goals.\\nIt enables them to share in a venture of common concerns and to reap the rewards of knowing that they can finance themselves without the assistance of the Federal Government.\\nIt is perhaps debatable whether these attributes should properly be valued at $100 per share, but we are not called upon merely to resolve a question of valuation.\\nRather, we must decide whether it is artificial to characterize these unique expenditures as payments for a capital asset.\\nWe find that it is not.\\nThe taxpayers and the Government each allege that the other is looking at form rather than substance.\\nAt some point, however, the form in which a transaction is cast must have considerable impact.\\nGuterman, Substance v. Form in the Taxation of Personal and Business Transactions, N. Y. U. 20th Inst. on Fed. Tax. 951 (1962).\\n*312 Congress chose to make the taxpayers buy stock;\\nCongress determined that the stock was worth $100 a share;\\nand this stock was endowed with a long-term value.\\nWhile Congress might have been able to achieve the same ends through additional interest payments, it chose the form of stock purchases.\\nThis form assures long-term commitment and has bearing on the tax consequences of the purchases.\\nAccordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded with direction that judgment be entered for the United States.\\nIt is so ordered.\\n', '*29 JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nBefore seeking a federal writ of habeas corpus, a state prisoner must exhaust available state remedies, 28 U. S. C. § 2254(b)(1), thereby giving the State the \"`\"opportunity to pass upon and correct\" alleged violations of its prisoners\\' federal rights.\\'\"\\nDuncan v. Henry, 513 U. S. 364 , 365 (1995) (per curiam) (quoting Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S. 270 , 275 (1971)).\\nTo provide the State with the necessary \"opportunity,\" the prisoner must \"fairly present\" his claim in each appropriate state court (including a state supreme court with powers of discretionary review), thereby alerting that court to the federal nature of the claim.\\nDuncan, supra, at 365-366; O\\'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838 , 845 (1999).\\nThis case focuses upon the requirement of \"fair presentation.\"\\nMichael Reese, the respondent, appealed his state-court kidnaping and attempted sodomy convictions and sentences through Oregon\\'s state court system.\\nHe then brought collateral relief proceedings in the state courts (where he was represented by appointed counsel).\\nAfter the lower courts denied him collateral relief, Reese filed a petition for discretionary review in the Oregon Supreme Court.\\nThe petition made several different legal claims.\\nIn relevant part, the petition asserted that Reese had received \"ineffective assistance of both trial court and appellate court counsel.\"\\nApp. 47.\\nThe petition added that \"his imprisonment *30 is in violation of [Oregon state law].\"\\nId., at 48.\\nIt said that his trial counsel\\'s conduct violated several provisions of the Federal Constitution.\\nIbid.\\nBut it did not say that his separate appellate \"ineffective assistance\" claim violated federal law.\\nThe Oregon Supreme Court denied review.\\nReese ultimately sought a federal writ of habeas corpus, raising, among other claims, a federal constitutional claim that his appellate counsel did not effectively represent him during one of his direct state-court appeals.\\nThe Federal District Court held that Reese had not \"fairly presented\" his federal \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim to the higher state courts because his brief in the state appeals court had not indicated that he was complaining about a violation of federal law.\\nA divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court.\\n282 F. 3d 1184 (2002).\\nAlthough the majority apparently believed that Reese\\'s petition itself did not alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of the appellate \"ineffective assistance\" claim, it did not find that fact determinative.\\nId., at 1193-1194.\\nRather, it found that Reese had satisfied the \"fair presentation\" requirement because the justices of the Oregon Supreme Court had had \"the opportunity to read . . . the lower [Oregon] court decision claimed to be in error before deciding whether to grant discretionary review.\"\\nId., at 1194 (emphasis added).\\nHad they read the opinion of the lower state trial court, the majority added, the justices would have, or should have, realized that Reese\\'s claim rested upon federal law.\\nIbid.\\nWe granted certiorari to determine whether the Ninth Circuit has correctly interpreted the \"fair presentation\" requirement.\\nWe begin by assuming that Reese\\'s petition by itself did not properly alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of Reese\\'s claim.\\nOn that assumption, Reese failed *31 to meet the \"fair presentation\" standard, and the Ninth Circuit was wrong to hold the contrary.\\nWe recognize that the justices of the Oregon Supreme Court did have an \"opportunity\" to read the lower court opinions in Reese\\'s case.\\nThat opportunity means that the judges could have read them.\\nBut to say that a petitioner \"fairly presents\" a federal claim when an appellate judge can discover that claim only by reading lower court opinions in the case is to say that those judges must read the lower court opinions \\x97 for otherwise they would forfeit the State\\'s opportunity to decide that federal claim in the first instance.\\nIn our view, federal habeas corpus law does not impose such a requirement.\\nFor one thing, the requirement would force state appellate judges to alter their ordinary review practices.\\nAppellate judges, of course, will often read lower court opinions, but they do not necessarily do so in every case.\\nSometimes an appellate court can decide a legal question on the basis of the briefs alone.\\nThat is particularly so where the question at issue is whether to exercise a discretionary power of review, i. e., whether to review the merits of a lower court decision.\\nIn such instances, the nature of the issue may matter more than does the legal validity of the lower court decision.\\nAnd the nature of the issue alone may lead the court to decide not to hear the case.\\nIndeed, the Oregon Supreme Court is a court with a discretionary power of review.\\nAnd Oregon Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.05(7) (2003) instructs litigants seeking discretionary review to identify clearly in the petition itself the legal questions presented, why those questions have special importance, a short statement of relevant facts, and the reasons for reversal, \"including appropriate authorities.\"\\nFor another thing, the opinion-reading requirement would impose a serious burden upon judges of state appellate courts, particularly those with discretionary review powers.\\nThose courts have heavy workloads, which would be significantly *32 increased if their judges had to read through lower court opinions or briefs in every instance.\\nSee National Center for State Courts, State Court Caseload Statistics 2002, pp. 106-110 (Table 2)\\nFinally, we do not find such a requirement necessary to avoid imposing unreasonable procedural burdens upon state prisoners who may eventually seek habeas corpus.\\nA litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state-court petition or brief, for example, by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim \"federal.\"\\nFor these reasons, we believe that the requirement imposed by the Ninth Circuit would unjustifiably undercut the considerations of federal-state comity that the exhaustion requirement seeks to promote.\\nWe consequently hold that ordinarily a state prisoner does not \"fairly present\" a claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition or a brief (or a similar document) that does not alert it to the presence of a federal claim in order to find material, such as a lower court opinion in the case, that does so.\\nReese argues in the alternative that it is wrong to assume that his petition by itself failed to alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of his \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim.\\nWe do not agree.\\nReese must concede that his petition does not explicitly say that the words \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" refer to a federal claim.\\nThe petition refers to provisions of the Federal Constitution in respect to other claims but not in respect to this one.\\nThe petition provides no citation of any case that might have alerted the court to the alleged federal nature of the claim.\\nAnd the petition does not even contain a factual description supporting the claim.\\nCf. Gray v. Netherland, 518 U. S. 152 , 163 (1996);\\nDuncan, 513 U. S., at 366 .\\nReese asserts that the petition nonetheless \"fairly presents\" a federal \"ineffective assistance of appellate counsel\" claim for two reasons.\\nFirst, he says that the word \"ineffective\" is a term of art in Oregon that refers only to federal-law claims and not to similar state-law claims, which, he adds, in Oregon are solely referred to as \"inadequate assistance\" claims.\\nAnd thus the Oregon Supreme Court should have known, from his use of the word \"ineffective,\" that his claim was federal.\\nReese, however, has not demonstrated that Oregon law uses the words \"ineffective assistance\" in the manner he suggests, that is, as referring only to a federal-law claim.\\nSee, e. g., Lichau v. Baldwin, 166 Ore. App. 411, 415, 417, 999 P. 2d 1207 , 1210, 1211 (2000)\\n(using \"ineffective assistance\" to refer to violations of the Oregon Constitution)\\nev\\'d in part, 333 Ore. 350 , 39 P. 3d 851 (2002).\\nIndeed, Reese\\'s own petition uses both phrases \\x97 \"ineffective assistance\" and \"inadequate assistance\" \\x97 at different points to refer to what is apparently a single claim.\\nSecond, Reese says that in Oregon the standards for adjudicating state and federal \"inadequate/ineffective appellate assistance\" claims are identical.\\nHe adds that, where that identity exists, a petitioner need not indicate a claim\\'s federal nature, because, by raising a state-law claim, he would necessarily \"fairly present\" the corresponding federal claim.\\n*34 However, the Ninth Circuit did not address this argument,\\nand our reading of the briefs filed in the Ninth Circuit leads us to conclude that Reese did not there seek consideration of the argument in that court.\\nIndeed, the argument first made its appearance in this Court in Reese\\'s brief on the merits.\\nUnder this Court\\'s Rule 15.2, \"a nonjurisdictional argument not raised in a respondent\\'s brief in opposition to a petition for a writ of certiorari may be deemed waived.\"\\nCaterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61 , 75, n. 13 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).\\nThis argument falls squarely within the rule.\\nThe complex nature of Reese\\'s claim and its broad implications suggest that its consideration by the lower courts would help in its resolution.\\nHence, without expressing any view on the merits of the issue, we exercise our Rule 15.2 discretion and deem the argument waived in this Court.\\nSee, e. g., Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U. S. 249 , 253-254 (1999) (per curiam);\\nSouth Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U. S. 160 , 171 (1999);\\ncf. Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51 , 56, n. 4 (2002).\\nFor these reasons, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is Reversed.\\n', '*37 JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nThe issue here is whether the Fourth Amendment prohibits the warrantless search and seizure of garbage left for collection outside the curtilage of a home.\\nWe conclude, in accordance with the vast majority of lower courts that have addressed the issue, that it does not.\\nIn early 1984, Investigator Jenny Stracner of the Laguna Beach Police Department received information indicating that respondent Greenwood might be engaged in narcotics trafficking.\\nStracner learned that a criminal suspect had informed a federal drug enforcement agent in February 1984 that a truck filled with illegal drugs was en route to the Laguna Beach address at which Greenwood resided.\\nIn addition, a neighbor complained of heavy vehicular traffic late at night in front of Greenwood\\'s single-family home.\\nThe neighbor reported that the vehicles remained at Greenwood\\'s house for only a few minutes.\\nStracner sought to investigate this information by conducting a surveillance of Greenwood\\'s home.\\nShe observed several vehicles make brief stops at the house during the late-night and early morning hours, and she followed a truck from the house to a residence that had previously been under investigation as a narcotics-trafficking location.\\nOn April 6, 1984, Stracner asked the neighborhood\\'s regular trash collector to pick up the plastic garbage bags that Greenwood had left on the curb in front of his house and to turn the bags over to her without mixing their contents with garbage from other houses.\\nThe trash collector cleaned his truck bin of other refuse, collected the garbage bags from the street in front of Greenwood\\'s house, and turned the bags over to Stracner.\\nThe officer searched through the rubbish *38 and found items indicative of narcotics use.\\nShe recited the information that she had gleaned from the trash search in an affidavit in support of a warrant to search Greenwood\\'s home.\\nPolice officers encountered both respondents at the house later that day when they arrived to execute the warrant.\\nThe police discovered quantities of cocaine and hashish during their search of the house.\\nRespondents were arrested on felony narcotics charges.\\nThey subsequently posted bail.\\nThe police continued to receive reports of many late-night visitors to the Greenwood house.\\nOn May 4, Investigator Robert Rahaeuser obtained Greenwood\\'s garbage from the regular trash collector in the same manner as had Stracner.\\nThe garbage again contained evidence of narcotics use.\\nRahaeuser secured another search warrant for Greenwood\\'s home based on the information from the second trash search.\\nThe police found more narcotics and evidence of narcotics trafficking when they executed the warrant.\\nGreenwood was again arrested.\\nThe Superior Court dismissed the charges against respondents on the authority of People v. Krivda, 5 Cal. 3d 357 , 486 P.2d 1262 (1971), which held that warrantless trash searches violate the Fourth Amendment and the California Constitution.\\nThe court found that the police would not have had probable cause to search the Greenwood home without the evidence obtained from the trash searches.\\nThe Court of Appeal affirmed.\\n182 Cal. App. 3d 729, 227 Cal. Rptr. 539 (1986).\\nThe court noted at the outset that the fruits of warrantless trash searches could no longer be suppressed if Krivda were based only on the California Constitution, because since 1982 the State has barred the suppression of evidence seized in violation of California law but not federal law.\\nSee Cal.

United States, 389 U.S. 347 , 361 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring)\\nRespondents do not disagree with this standard.\\nThey assert, however, that they had, and exhibited, an expectation of privacy with respect to the trash that was searched by the police:\\nThe trash, which was placed on the street for collection at a fixed time, was contained in opaque plastic bags, which the garbage collector was expected to pick up, mingle with the trash of others, and deposit at the garbage dump.\\nThe trash was only temporarily on the street, and there was little likelihood that it would be inspected by anyone.\\nIt may well be that respondents did not expect that the contents of their garbage bags would become known to the police or other members of the public.\\nAn expectation of privacy does not give rise to Fourth Amendment protection, *40 however, unless society is prepared to accept that expectation as objectively reasonable.\\nHere, we conclude that respondents exposed their garbage to the public sufficiently to defeat their claim to Fourth Amendment protection.\\nIt is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals, [2] children, scavengers, [3] snoops, [4] and other members of the public.\\nSee Krivda, supra , at 367, 486 P.2d, at 1269 .\\nMoreover, respondents placed their refuse at the curb for the express purpose of conveying it to a third party, the trash collector, who might himself have sorted through respondents\\' trash or permitted others, such as the police, to do so.\\nAccordingly, having deposited their garbage \"in an area particularly suited for *41 public inspection and, in a manner of speaking, public consumption, for the express purpose of having strangers take it,\" United States v. Reicherter, 647 F.2d 397 , 399 (CA3 1981), respondents could have had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the inculpatory items that they discarded.\\nFurthermore, as we have held, the police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by any member of the public.\\nHence, \"[w]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\"\\nKatz v. United States, supra, at 351.\\nWe held in Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979), for example, that the police did not violate the Fourth Amendment by causing a pen register to be installed at the telephone company\\'s offices to record the telephone numbers dialed by a criminal suspect.\\nAn individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in the numbers dialed on his telephone, we reasoned, because he voluntarily conveys those numbers to the telephone company when he uses the telephone.\\nAgain, we observed that \"a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties.\"\\nId., at 743-744.\\nSimilarly, we held in California v.

[5]\\nWe reject respondent Greenwood\\'s alternative argument for affirmance: that his expectation of privacy in his garbage should be deemed reasonable as a matter of federal constitutional law because the warrantless search and seizure of his garbage was impermissible as a matter of California law.\\nHe urges that the state-law right of Californians to privacy in their garbage, announced by the California Supreme Court in Krivda, supra , survived the subsequent state constitutional amendment eliminating the suppression remedy as a means of enforcing that right.\\nSee In re Lance W., 37 Cal. 3d, at 886-887, 694 P.2d, at 752-753 .\\nHence, he argues that the Fourth Amendment should itself vindicate that right.\\nIndividual States may surely construe their own constitutions as imposing more stringent constraints on police conduct than does the Federal Constitution.\\nWe have never intimated, however, that whether or not a search is reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment depends on the law of the particular State in which the search occurs.\\nWe have emphasized instead that the Fourth Amendment analysis must turn on such factors as \"our societal understanding that certain areas deserve the most scrupulous protection from government invasion.\"\\nOliver v. United States, 466 U. S., at 178 (emphasis added).\\nSee also Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 143-144, n. 12 (1978).\\nWe have already concluded that society as a whole possesses no such understanding *44 with regard to garbage left for collection at the side of a public street.\\nRespondent\\'s argument is no less than a suggestion that concepts of privacy under the laws of each State are to determine the reach of the Fourth Amendment.\\nWe do not accept this submission.\\nGreenwood finally urges as an additional ground for affirmance that the California constitutional amendment eliminating the exclusionary rule for evidence seized in violation of state but not federal law violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\nIn his view, having recognized a state-law right to be free from warrantless searches of garbage, California may not under the Due Process Clause deprive its citizens of what he describes as \"the only effective deterrent\" to violations of this right.\\nGreenwood concedes that no direct support for his position can be found in the decisions of this Court.\\nHe relies instead on cases holding that individuals are entitled to certain procedural protections before they can be deprived of a liberty or property interest created by state law.\\nSee Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460 (1983);\\nVitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480 (1980).\\nWe see no merit in Greenwood\\'s position.\\nCalifornia could amend its Constitution to negate the holding in Krivda that state law forbids warrantless searches of trash.\\nWe are convinced that the State may likewise eliminate the exclusionary rule as a remedy for violations of that right.\\nAt the federal level, we have not required that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment be suppressed in all circumstances.\\nSee, e. g., United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984);\\nUnited States v. Janis, 428 U.S. 433 (1976);\\nUnited States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338 (1974).\\nRather, our decisions concerning the scope of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule have balanced the benefits of deterring police misconduct against the costs of excluding reliable evidence of criminal activity.\\nSee Leon, 468 U. S., at 908-913.\\nWe *45 have declined to apply the exclusionary rule indiscriminately \"when law enforcement officers have acted in objective good faith or their transgressions have been minor,\" because \"the magnitude of the benefit conferred on . . . guilty defendants [in such circumstances] offends basic concepts of the criminal justice system.\"\\nId., at 908 (citing Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465 , 490 (1976)).\\nThe States are not foreclosed by the Due Process Clause from using a similar balancing approach to delineate the scope of their own exclusionary rules.\\nHence, the people of California could permissibly conclude that the benefits of excluding relevant evidence of criminal activity do not outweigh the costs when the police conduct at issue does not violate federal law.\\nThe judgment of the California Court of Appeal is therefore reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\\nIt is so ordered.\\n', 'JUSTICE O\\'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nAt issue in this case are the limits imposed by federal law upon state court habeas corpus proceedings challenging an extradition warrant.\\nRichard and Judith Smolin were divorced in California in 1978.\\nSole custody of their two children, Jennifer and Jamie, was awarded to Judith Smolin, subject to reasonable visitation rights for Richard.\\nUntil November 1979, all the parties remained in San Bernardino County, California, and Richard apparently paid his child support and exercised his visitation rights without serious incident.\\nIn August 1979, however, Judith married James Pope, and in November, Mr. Pope\\'s work required that the family relocate to Oregon.\\nWhen the Popes moved without informing Richard, the battle over the custody of the minor children began in earnest.\\nIt is unnecessary to recite in detail all that ensued.\\nRichard alleged, and the California courts later found, that the Popes deliberately attempted to defeat Richard\\'s visitation rights and to preclude him from forming a meaningful relationship with his children in the course of their succeeding relocations from Oregon to Texas to Louisiana.\\nOn February 13, 1981, the Popes obtained a decree from a Texas court granting full faith and credit to the original California order awarding sole custody to Judith.\\nRichard was served but did not appear in the Texas proceeding.\\nBefore the Texas decree was issued, however, Richard sought and obtained in California Superior Court modification of the underlying California decree, awarding joint custody to Richard and Judith.\\nThough properly served, the Popes did not appear in these *403 California proceedings; and, though served with the modification order, the Popes neither complied with its terms, nor notified the Texas court of its existence.\\nOn January 9, 1981, Richard instituted an action in California Superior Court to find Judith in contempt and to again modify the custody decree to give him sole custody.\\nIn February 1981, sole custody was granted to Richard by the California court, subject to reasonable visitation rights for Judith.\\nThis order also was ignored by the Popes, apparently acting on the advice of counsel that the California courts no longer had jurisdiction over the matter.\\nRichard did not in fact obtain physical custody for over two years.\\nWhen he finally located the Popes in Louisiana, they began an adoption proceeding, later described by the California courts as \"verging on the fraudulent,\" to sever Richard\\'s legal tie to Jennifer and Jamie. App. 51.\\nAfter securing a California warrant to obtain custody of the children on February 27, 1984, Richard and his father, Gerard Smolin, resorted to self-help.\\nOn March 9, 1984, they picked up Jennifer and Jamie as they were waiting for their school bus in Slidell, Louisiana, and brought them back to California.\\nOn April 11, 1984, the Popes submitted to the jurisdiction of the California Superior Court and instituted an action to modify the 1981 order granting Richard sole custody.\\n41 Cal. 3d 758 , 764, n. 4, 716 P.2d 991 , 994, n. 4 (1986).\\nThose proceedings are apparently still pending before the California courts.\\nMeanwhile, the Popes raised the stakes by instituting a criminal action against Richard and Gerard Smolin in Louisiana.\\nOn April 30, 1984, after the Popes instituted modification proceedings in California, Judith Pope swore out an affidavit charging Richard and Gerard Smolin with kidnaping Jennifer and Jamie from her custody and asserting that they had acted \"without authority to remove children from [her] custody.\"\\nApp. B to Pet. for Cert. 6.\\nOn the basis of this affidavit, the Assistant District Attorney for the 22d Judicial District of Louisiana, William Alford, Jr., filed an information *404 charging Richard and Gerard Smolin each with two counts of violating La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 14:45 (West 1986), the Louisiana kidnaping statute.\\nOn June 14, 1984, the Governor of Louisiana formally notified the Governor of California that Richard and Gerard Smolin were charged with \"simple kidnaping\" in Louisiana and demanded that they be delivered up for trial.\\n41 Cal. 3d, at 763 , 716 P. 2d, at 993-994.\\nIn early August 1984, the Smolins petitioned in the California Superior Court for a writ of habeas corpus to block the anticipated extradition warrants.\\nOn August 17, 1984, the anticipated warrants issued and on August 24, 1984, the Superior Court orally granted a writ of habeas corpus after taking judicial notice of the various custody orders that had been issued.\\nThe court concluded \"that the findings in the family law case adequately demonstrate that, in fact, the process initiated by Mrs. Pope in Louisiana and her declarations and affidavits were totally insufficient to establish any basis for rights of either herself personally or for the State . . . of Louisiana.\"\\nApp. C to Pet. for Cert. 5.\\nCalifornia then sought a writ of mandate in the California Court of Appeal on the ground that the Superior Court had abused its discretion in blocking extradition.\\nThe Court of Appeal reluctantly issued the writ:\\n\"Although we abhor Judy\\'s apparent willingness to take advantage of our federal system to further this custody battle, and are sympathetic to [the Smolins\\'] position, we must conclude that their arguments are irrelevant to the only issue a court in the asylum state may properly address: are the documents on their face in order.\"\\nApp. B to Pet. for Cert. 16.\\nA divided California Supreme Court reversed.\\nThe majority interpreted the Superior Court\\'s finding to be that the Smolins were not substantially charged with a crime.\\nIt found that the California custody decrees were properly considered *405 by the Superior Court, and that its conclusion that the Smolins were not substantially charged was correct.\\nUnder the full faith and credit provisions of the federal Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act of 1980, 28 U.S. C. § 1738A, the majority determined that those decrees conclusively established that Richard Smolin was the lawful custodian of the children at the time that they were taken from Louisiana to California. [*]\\nFinally, the court found that, under Louisiana law, the lawful custodian cannot be guilty of kidnaping children in his custody.\\nState v. Elliott, 171 La. 306 , 311, 131 So. 28 , 30 (1930).\\nWe granted certiorari, 479 U.S. 982 (1986), to consider whether the Extradition Clause, Art. IV, § 2, cl. 2, and the Extradition Act, 18 U.S. C. § 3182, prevent the California Supreme Court from refusing to permit extradition on these grounds.\\nThe Federal Constitution places certain limits on the sovereign powers of the States, limits that are an essential part of the Framers\\' conception of national identity and Union.\\nOne such limit is found in Art. IV, § 2, cl. 2, the Extradition Clause:\\n\"A person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority *406 of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime.\"\\nThe obvious objective of the Extradition Clause is that no State should become a safe haven for the fugitives from a sister State\\'s criminal justice system.\\nAs this Court noted in its first opportunity to construe the Extradition Clause:\\n\"[T]he statesmen who framed the Constitution were fully sensible, that from the complex character of the Government, it must fail unless the States mutually supported each other and the General Government; and that nothing would be more likely to disturb its peace, and end in discord, than permitting an offender against the laws of a State, by passing over a mathematical line which divides it from another, to defy its process, and stand ready, under the protection of the State, to repeat the offense as soon as another opportunity offered.\"\\nKentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 , 100 (1861).\\nThe Extradition Clause, however, does not specifically establish a procedure by which interstate extradition is to take place, and, accordingly, has never been considered to be self-executing.\\nSee, e. g., Hyatt v. People ex rel. Corkran, 188 U.S. 691 , 708-709 (1903); Kentucky v. Dennison, supra, at 104.\\nEarly in our history, the lack of an established procedure led to a bitter dispute between the States of Virginia and Pennsylvania.\\nJ. Scott, Law of Interstate Rendition 5-7 (1917).\\nIn 1791, Pennsylvania demanded the extradition of three men charged with kidnaping a free black man and selling him into slavery.\\nVirginia refused to comply with Pennsylvania\\'s demand.\\nThe controversy was finally submitted to President Washington who, relying upon the advice of Attorney General Randolph, 9 National State Papers of the United States 1789-1817, pt. II, pp. 144-145 (E. Carzo ed. 1985), personally appeared before the Congress to obtain the enactment of a law to regulate the extradition process.\\nCongress *407 responded by enacting the Extradition Act of 1793, which provides in its current form:\\n\"Whenever the executive authority of any State or Territory demands any person as a fugitive from justice, of the executive authority of any State, District or Territory to which such person has fled, and produces a copy of an indictment found or an affidavit made before a magistrate of any State or Territory, charging the person demanded with having committed treason, felony or other crime, certified as authentic by the governor or chief magistrate of the State or Territory from whence the person so charged has fled, the executive authority of the State, District or Territory to which such person has fled shall cause him to be arrested and secured, and notify the executive authority making such demand, or the agent of such authority appointed to receive the fugitive, and shall cause the fugitive to be delivered to such agent when he shall appear.\"\\n18 U.S. C. § 3182.\\nThis Court has held the Extradition Act of 1793 to be a proper exercise of Congress\\' powers under the Extradition Clause and Art. IV, § 1, to \"prescribe the manner in which acts, records and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof.\"\\nKentucky v. Dennison, supra, at 105; Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539 , 618-622 (1842).\\nBy the express terms of federal law, therefore, the asylum State is bound to deliver up to the demanding State\\'s agent a fugitive against whom a properly certified indictment or affidavit charging a crime is lodged.\\nThe language, history, and subsequent construction of the Extradition Act make clear that Congress intended extradition to be a summary procedure.\\nAs we have repeatedly held, extradition proceedings are \"to be kept within narrow bounds\";\\nthey are \"emphatically\" not the appropriate time or place for entertaining defenses or determining the guilt or innocence of the charged party.\\nBiddinger v. Commissioner *408 of Police, 245 U.S. 128 , 135 (1917);\\nsee also, e. g., Michigan v. Doran, 439 U.S. 282 , 288 (1978);\\nDrew v. Thaw, 235 U.S. 432 , 440 (1914);\\nPierce v. Creecy, 210 U.S. 387 , 405 (1908);\\nIn re Strauss, 197 U.S. 324 , 332-333 (1905).\\nThose inquiries are left to the professorial authorities and courts of the demanding State, whose duty it is to justly enforce the demanding State\\'s criminal law \\x97 subject, of course, to the limitations imposed by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\\nBiddinger v. Commissioner of Police, supra, at 135;\\nDrew v. Thaw, supra , at 440.\\nThe courts of asylum States may do no more than ascertain whether the requisites of the Extradition Act have been met.\\nAs the Court held in Michigan v. Doran, supra , the Act leaves only four issues open for consideration before the fugitive is delivered up\\n\"(a) whether the extradition documents on their face are in order; (b) whether the petitioner has been charged with a crime in the demanding state; (c) whether the petitioner is the person named in the request for extradition; and (d) whether the petitioner is a fugitive.\"\\n439 U.S., at 289 .\\nThe parties argue at length about the propriety of the California courts taking judicial notice of their prior child custody decrees in this extradition proceeding.\\nBut even if taking judicial notice of the decrees is otherwise proper, the question remains whether the decrees noticed were relevant to one of these four inquiries.\\nThe Smolins do not dispute that the extradition documents are in order, that they are the persons named in the documents and that they meet the technical definition of a \"fugitive.\"\\nTheir sole contention is that, in light of the earlier California custody decrees and the federal Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act of 1980, 28 U.S. C. § 1738A, they have not been properly charged with a violation of Louisiana\\'s kidnaping statute,\\nLa. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 14:45 (West 1986).\\nSection 14:45A(4) prohibits the \"intentional taking, enticing or decoying away and removing from the state, by any parent, of his or her child, from the custody of any person to whom custody has been awarded by any court of competent jurisdiction of any state, without the consent of the legal custodian, with intent to defeat the jurisdiction of the said court over the custody of the child.\"\\nA properly certified Louisiana information charges the Smolins with violating this statute by kidnaping Jennifer and Jamie Smolin.\\nThe information is based on the sworn affidavit of Judith Pope which asserts:\\n\" `On March 9, 1984, at approximately 7:20 a. m., Richard Smolin and Gerard Smolin, kidnapped Jennifer Smolin, aged 10, and James C. Smolin, aged 9, from the affiant\\'s custody while said children were at a bus stop in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana. \"The affiant has custody of the said children by virtue of a Texas court order dated February 5, 1981, a copy of said order attached hereto and made part hereof. The information regarding the actual kidnapping was told to the affiant by witnesses Mason Galatas and Cheryl Galatas of 2028 Mallard Street, Slidell, Louisiana, and Jimmie Huessler of 2015 Dridle Street, Slidell, Louisiana. Richard Smolin and Gerard Smolin were without authority to remove children from affiant\\'s custody.\\' \"\\nApp. B to Pet. for Cert. 5-6.\\nThe information is in proper form,\\nand the Smolins do not dispute that the affidavit, and documents incorporated by reference therein, set forth facts that clearly satisfy each element of the crime of kidnaping as it is defined in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 14:45A(4) (West 1986).\\nIf we accept as true every fact alleged, the Smolins are properly charged with kidnaping under Louisiana law.\\nIn our view, this ends the inquiry into the issue whether or not a crime is charged for purposes of the Extradition Act.\\n*410 The Smolins argue, however, that more than a formal charge is required, citing the following language from Roberts v. Reilly, 116 U.S. 80 , 95 (1885):\\n\"It must appear, therefore, to the governor of the State to whom such a demand is presented, before he can lawfully comply with it, first, that the person demanded is substantially charged with a crime against the laws of the State from whose justice he is alleged to have fled, by an indictment or an affidavit, certified as authentic by the governor of the State making the demand. . . . \"[This] is a question of law, and is always open upon the face of the papers to judicial inquiry, on an application for a discharge under a writ of habeas corpus.\"\\nThe Smolins claim that this language in Roberts spawned a widespread practice of permitting the fugitive, upon a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the asylum State\\'s courts, to show that the demanding State\\'s charging instrument is so insufficient that it cannot withstand some generalized version of a motion to dismiss or common-law demurrer.\\nTr. of Oral Arg. 29-36.\\nThe cases the Smolins principally rely upon as support for this asserted practice are People ex rel. Lewis v. Commissioner of Correction of City of New York, 100 Misc. 2d 48, 417 N. Y. S. 2d 377 (1979), aff\\'d, 75 A.D. 2d 526, 426 N. Y. S. 2d 969 (1980), and Application of Varona, 38 Wash. 2d 833 , 232 P.2d 923 (1951).\\nSee Brief for Respondent 15-17.\\nIn Lewis, however, the New York trial court actually granted extradition despite its apparent misgivings about the substantiality of the criminal charge.\\nLewis, supra, at 56, 417 N. Y. S. 2d, at 382.\\nAnd, in Varona, the Washington Supreme Court relied on the fact that the indictment, on its face, did not charge a crime under California law.\\nApplication of Varona, supra, at 833-834, 232 P.2d, at 923-924 .\\nNeither case, in our view, supports the broad proposition that the asylum State\\'s courts may entertain motions to dismiss or demurrers to the indictment or information from the demanding State.\\n*411 To the contrary, our cases make clear that no such inquiry is permitted.\\nFor example, in Pierce v. Creecy, decided after Roberts, supra , this Court refused to grant relief from extradition over multiple objections to the sufficiency of the indictment.\\nThe Pierce Court concluded that it was enough that \"the indictment, whether good or bad, as a pleading, unmistakably describes every element of the crime of false swearing, as it is defined in the Texas Penal Code . . . .\"\\n210 U.S., at 404 .\\nIt reasoned:\\n\"If more were required it would impose upon courts, in the trial of writs of habeas corpus, the duty of a critical examination of the laws of States with whose jurisprudence and criminal procedure they can have only a general acquaintance. Such a duty would be an intolerable burden, certain to lead to errors in decision, irritable to the just pride of the States and fruitful of miscarriages of justice. The duty ought not be assumed unless it is plainly required by the Constitution, and, in our opinion, there is nothing in the letter or the spirit of that instrument which requires or permits its performance.\"\\nId., at 405.\\nSimilarly, in Biddinger v. Commissioner of Police, 245 U.S. 128 (1917), the appellant argued that he had a seemingly valid statute of limitations defense based on the fact that more than three years, the limitations period, had elapsed since the date of the crime recited in the indictment and that he had been publicly and openly resident in the demanding State for that entire period.\\nThe Court found that the question of limitations was properly considered only in the demanding State\\'s courts.\\nId., at 135; see also Drew v. Thaw, 235 U. S., at 439-440\\n(whether the escape of a person committed to a mental institution is a crime \"is a question as to the law of New York which the New York courts must decide\")\\nThis proceeding is neither the time nor place for the Smolins\\' arguments that Judith Pope\\'s affidavit is fraudulent *412 and that the California custody decrees establish Richard as the lawful custodian under the full faith and credit provision of the federal Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act of 1980.\\nThere is nothing in the record to suggest that the Smolins are not entirely correct in all of this: that California had exclusive modification jurisdiction over the custody of Jennifer and Jamie; that, under the California decrees, Richard Smolin had lawful custody of the children when he brought them to California; and, that, accordingly, the Smolins did not violate La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 14:45A(4) (West 1986) as is charged.\\nOf course, the Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act of 1980 creates a uniform federal rule governing custody determinations, a rule to which the courts of Louisiana must adhere when they consider the Smolins\\' case on the merits.\\nWe are not informed by the record why it is that the States of California and Louisiana are so eager to force the Smolins halfway across the continent to face criminal charges that, at least to a majority of the California Supreme Court, appear meritless.\\nIf the Smolins are correct, they are not only innocent of the charges made against them, but also victims of a possible abuse of the criminal process.\\nBut, under the Extradition Act, it is for the Louisiana courts to do justice in this case, not the California courts: \"surrender is not to be interfered with by the summary process of habeas corpus upon speculations as to what ought to be the result of a trial in the place where the Constitution provides for its taking place.\"\\nDrew v. Thaw, supra , at 440.\\nThe judgment of the California Supreme Court is Reversed.\\n', 'JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nThe issue in this case is whether a full-time gambler who makes wagers solely for his own account is engaged in a \"trade or business,\" within the meaning of §§ 162(a) and 62(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, 26 U.S. C. §§ 162(a) and 62(1) (1976 ed. and Supp. V). [1]\\nThe tax year with which we here are concerned is the calendar year 1978; technically, then, we look to the Code as it read at that time.\\nThere is no dispute as to the facts.\\nThe critical ones are stipulated.\\nSee App. 9.\\nRespondent Robert P. Groetzinger had worked for 20 years in sales and market research for an Illinois manufacturer when his position was terminated in February 1978.\\nDuring the remainder of that year, respondent busied himself with parimutuel wagering, primarily on greyhound races.\\nHe gambled at tracks in Florida and Colorado.\\nHe went to the track 6 days a week for 48 weeks in 1978.\\nHe spent a substantial amount of time studying racing forms, programs, and other materials.\\nHe devoted from 60 to 80 hours each week to these gambling-related endeavors.\\nHe never placed bets on behalf of any other person, or sold tips, or collected commissions for placing bets, or functioned as a bookmaker.\\nHe gambled solely for his own account.\\nHe had no other profession or type of employment. [2]\\n*25 Respondent kept a detailed accounting of his wagers and every day noted his winnings and losses in a record book.\\nIn 1978, he had gross winnings of $70,000, but he bet $72,032;\\nhe thus realized a net gambling loss for the year of $2,032.\\nRespondent received $6,498 in income from other sources in 1978.\\nThis came from interest, dividends, capital gains, and salary earned before his job was terminated.\\nOn the federal income tax return he filed for the calendar year 1978 respondent report as income only the $6,498 realized from nongambling sources.\\nHe did not report any gambling winnings or deduct any gambling losses. [3]\\nHe did not itemize deductions.\\nInstead, he computed his tax liability from the tax tables.\\nUpon audit, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that respondent\\'s $70,000 in gambling winnings were to be included in his gross income and that, pursuant to § 165(d) of the Code, 26 U.S. C. § 165(d), a deduction was to be allowed for his gambling losses to the extent of these gambling gains.\\nBut the Commissioner further determined that, under the law as it was in 1978, a portion of respondent\\'s $70,000 gambling-loss deduction was an item of tax preference and operated to subject him to the minimum tax under § 56(a) of the Code, 26 U.S. C. § 56(a) (1976 ed.).\\nAt that time, under statutory provisions in effect from 1976 until 1982, \"items of tax preference\" were lessened by certain deductions, but not by deductions not \"attributable to a trade or business carried on by the taxpayer.\"\\n§§ 57(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A), and § 62(1), 26 U.S. C. §§ 57(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A), and § 62(1) (1976 ed. and Supp. I). [4]\\nThese determinations by the Commissioner produced a § 56(a) minimum tax of $2,142 and, with certain other adjustments not now in dispute, resulted in a total asserted tax deficiency of $2,522 for respondent for 1978.\\nRespondent sought redetermination of the deficiency in the United States Tax Court.\\nThat court, in a reviewed decision, with only two judges dissenting, held that respondent was in the trade or business of gambling, and that, as a consequence, no part of his gambling losses constituted an item of tax preference in determining any minimum tax for 1978.\\n82 T.C. 793 (1984).\\nIn so ruling, the court adhered to its earlier court-reviewed decision in Ditunno v. Commissioner,\\n80 T.C. 362 (1983).\\nThe court in Ditunno, id., at 371, had overruled Gentile v. Commissioner, 65 T.C. 1 (1975), a case where it had rejected the Commissioner\\'s contention (contrary to his position here) that a full-time gambler was in a trade or business and therefore was subject to self-employment tax.\\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.\\n771 F.2d 269 (1985).\\nBecause of a conflict on the issue among Courts of Appeals, [5]\\nwe granted certiorari.\\n475 U.S. 1080 (1986).\\nThe phrase \"trade or business\" has been in § 162(a) and in that section\\'s predecessors for many years.\\nIndeed, the phrase is common in the Code, for it appears in over 50 sections and 800 subsections and in hundreds of places in proposed and final income tax regulations.\\nThe slightly longer phrases, \"carrying on a trade or business\" and \"engaging in a trade or business,\" themselves are used no less than 60 times in the Code.\\nThe concept thus has a well-known and almost constant presence on our tax-law terrain.\\nDespite this, the Code has never contained a definition of the words \"trade or business\" for general application, and no regulation has been issued expounding its meaning for all purposes. [6]\\nNeither has a broadly applicable authoritative judicial definition emerged. [7]\\nOur task in this case is to ascertain the meaning of the phrase as it appears in the sections of the Code with which we are here concerned. [8]\\nIn one of its early tax cases, Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U.S. 107 (1911), the Court was concerned with the Corporation Tax imposed by § 38 of the Tariff Act of 1909, ch. 6, 36 Stat. 112-117, and the status of being engaged in business.\\nIt said:\\n\" `Business\\' is a very comprehensive term *28 and embraces everything about which a person can be employed.\"\\n220 U.S., at 171 .\\nIt embraced the Bouvier Dictionary definition:\\n\"That which occupies the time, attention and labor of men for the purpose of a livelihood or profit.\"\\nIbid.\\nSee also Helvering v. Horst, 311 U.S. 112 , 118 (1940).\\nAnd Justice Frankfurter has observed that \"we assume that Congress uses common words in their popular meaning, as used in the common speech of men.\"\\nFrankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 536 (1947).\\nWith these general comments as significant background, we turn to pertinent cases decided here.\\nSnyder v. Commissioner, 295 U.S. 134 (1935), had to do with margin trading and capital gains, and held, in that context, that an investor, seeking merely to increase his holdings, was not engaged in a trade or business.\\nJustice Brandeis, in his opinion for the Court, noted that the Board of Tax Appeals theretofore had ruled that a taxpayer who devoted the major portion of his time to transactions on the stock exchange for the purpose of making a livelihood could treat losses incurred as having been sustained in the course of a trade or business.\\nHe went on to observe that no facts were adduced in Snyder to show that the taxpayer \"might properly be characterized as a `trader on an exchange who makes a living in buying and selling securities.\\' \"\\nId., at 139.\\nThese observations, thus, are dicta, but, by their use, the Court appears to have drawn a distinction between an active trader and an investor.\\nIn Deputy v. Du Pont, 308 U.S. 488 (1940), the Court was concerned with what were \"ordinary and necessary\" expenses of a taxpayer\\'s trade or business, within the meaning of § 23(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 799.\\nIn ascertaining whether carrying charges on short sales of stock were deductible as ordinary and necessary expenses of the taxpayer\\'s business, the Court assumed that the activities of the taxpayer in conserving and enhancing his estate constituted a trade or business, but nevertheless disallowed the *29 claimed deductions because they were not \"ordinary\" or \"necessary.\"\\n308 U.S., at 493-497 .\\nJustice Frankfurter, in a concurring opinion joined by Justice Reed, did not join the majority.\\nHe took the position that whether the taxpayer\\'s activities constituted a trade or business was \"open for determination,\" id., at 499, and observed:\\n\" `. . . carrying on any trade or business,\\' within the contemplation of § 23(a), involves holding one\\'s self out to others as engaged in the selling of goods or services. This the taxpayer did not do. . . . Without elaborating the reasons for this construction and not unmindful of opposing considerations, including appropriate regard for administrative practice, I prefer to make the conclusion explicit instead of making the hypothetical litigation-breeding assumption that this taxpayer\\'s activities, for which expenses were sought to be deducted, did constitute a `trade or business.\\' \"\\nIbid.\\nNext came Higgins v. Commissioner, 312 U.S. 212 (1941).\\nThere the Court, in a bare and brief unanimous opinion, ruled that salaries and other expenses incident to looking after one\\'s own investments in bonds and stocks were not deductible under § 23(a) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 179, as expenses paid or incurred in carrying on a trade or business.\\nWhile surely cutting back on Flint\\'s broad approach, the Court seemed to do little more than announce that since 1918 \"the present form [of the statute] was fixed and has so continued\"; that \"[n]o regulation has ever been promulgated which interprets the meaning of `carrying on a business\\' \"; that the comprehensive definition of \"business\" in Flint was \"not controlling in this dissimilar inquiry\"; that the facts in each case must be examined; that not all expenses of every business transaction are deductible; and that \"[n]o matter how large the estate or how continuous or extended the work required may be, such facts are not sufficient as a matter of law to permit the courts to reverse the decision of the Board.\"\\n312 U.S., at 215-218 .\\nThe opinion, therefore \\x97 although devoid *30 of analysis and not setting forth what elements, if any, in addition to profit motive and regularity, were required to render an activity a trade or business \\x97 must stand for the propositions that full-time market activity in managing and preserving one\\'s own estate is not embraced within the phrase \"carrying on a business,\" and that salaries and other expenses incident to the operation are not deductible as having been paid or incurred in a trade or business. [9]\\nSee also United States v. Gilmore, 372 U.S. 39 , 44-45 (1963); Whipple v. Commissioner, 373 U.S. 193 (1963).\\nIt is of interest to note that, although Justice Frankfurter was on the Higgins Court and this time did not write separately, and although Justice Reed, who had joined the concurring opinion in Du Pont, was the author of the Higgins opinion, the Court in that case did not even cite Du Pont and thus paid no heed whatsoever to the content of Justice Frankfurter\\'s pronouncement in his concurring opinion. [10]\\nAdoption of the Frankfurter gloss obviously would have disposed of the case in the Commissioner\\'s favor handily and automatically, but that easy route was not followed.\\nLess than three months later, the Court considered the issue of the deductibility, as business expenses, of estate and trust fees.\\nIn unanimous opinions issued the same day and written by Justice Black, the Court ruled that the efforts *31 of an estate or trust in asset conservation and maintenance did not constitute a trade or business.\\nCity Bank Farmers Trust Co. v. Helvering, 313 U.S. 121 (1941); United States v. Pyne, 313 U.S. 127 (1941).\\nThe Higgins case was deemed to be relevant and controlling.\\nAgain, no mention was made of the Frankfurter concurrence in Du Pont.\\nYet Justices Reed and Frankfurter were on the Court.\\nSnow v. Commissioner, 416 U.S. 500 (1974), concerned a taxpayer who had advanced capital to a partnership formed to develop an invention.\\nOn audit of his 1966 return, a claimed deduction under § 174(a)(1) of the 1954 Code for his pro rata share of the partnership\\'s operating loss was disallowed.\\nThe Tax Court and the Sixth Circuit upheld that disallowance.\\nThis Court reversed.\\nJustice Douglas, writing for the eight Justices who participated, observed:\\n\"Section 174 was enacted in 1954 to dilute some of the conception of `ordinary and necessary\\' business expenses under § 162(a) (then § 23(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) adumbrated by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in a concurring opinion in Deputy v. Du Pont . . . where he said that the section in question . . . `involves holding one\\'s self out to others as engaged in the selling of goods or services.\\' \"\\n416 U.S., at 502-503 .\\nHe went on to state, id., at 503, that § 162(a) \"is more narrowly written than is § 174.\"\\nFrom these observations and decisions, we conclude (1) that, to be sure, the statutory words are broad and comprehensive (Flint); (2) that, however, expenses incident to caring for one\\'s own investments, even though that endeavor is full time, are not deductible as paid or incurred in carrying on a trade or business (Higgins; City Bank; Pyne); (3) that the opposite conclusion may follow for an active trader (Snyder); (4) that Justice Frankfurter\\'s attempted gloss upon the decision in Du Pont was not adopted by the Court in that case; (5) that the Court, indeed, later characterized it as an \"adumbration\" (Snow); and (6) that the Frankfurter observation, specifically or by implication, never has been accepted *32 as law by a majority opinion of the Court, and more than once has been totally ignored.\\nWe must regard the Frankfurter gloss merely as a two-Justice pronouncement in a passing moment and, while entitled to respect, as never having achieved the status of a Court ruling.\\nOne also must acknowledge that Higgins, with its stress on examining the facts in each case, affords no readily helpful standard, in the usual sense, with which to decide the present case and others similar to it.\\nThe Court\\'s cases, thus, give us results, but little general guidance.\\nFederal and state legislation and court decisions, perhaps understandably, until recently have not been noticeably favorable to gambling endeavors and even have been reluctant to treat gambling on a parity with more \"legitimate\" means of making a living.\\nSee, e. g., § 4401 et seq. of the Code; Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39 , 44-46, and nn. 5 and 6 (1968). [11]\\nAnd the confinement of gambling-loss deductions to the amount of gambling gains, a provision brought into the income tax law as § 23(g) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 689, and carried forward into § 165(d) of the 1954 Code, closed the door on suspected abuses, see H. R. Rep. No. 704, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 22 (1934); S. Rep. No. 558, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 25 (1934), but served partially to differentiate genuine gambling losses from many other types of adverse financial consequences sustained during the tax year.\\nGambling winnings, however, have not been isolated from gambling losses.\\nThe Congress has been realistic enough to recognize that such losses do exist and do have some effect on income, which is the primary focus of the federal income tax.\\nThe issue this case presents has \"been around\" for a long time and, as indicated above, has not met with consistent treatment in the Tax Court itself or in the Federal Courts of *33 Appeals.\\nThe Seventh Circuit, in the present case, said the issue \"has proven to be most difficult and troublesome over the years.\"\\n771 F.2d, at 271 .\\nThe difficulty has not been ameliorated by the persistent absence of an all-purpose definition, by statute or regulation, of the phrase \"trade or business\" which so frequently appears in the Code.\\nOf course, this very frequency well may be the explanation for legislative and administrative reluctance to take a position as to one use that might affect, with confusion, so many others.\\nBe that as it may, this taxpayer\\'s case must be decided and, from what we have outlined above, must be decided in the face of a decisional history that is not positive or even fairly indicative, as we read the cases, of what the result should be.\\nThere are, however, some helpful indicators.\\nIf a taxpayer, as Groetzinger is stipulated to have done in 1978, devotes his full-time activity to gambling, and it is his intended livelihood source, it would seem that basic concepts of fairness (if there be much of that in the income tax law) demand that his activity be regarded as a trade or business just as any other readily accepted activity, such as being a retail store proprietor or, to come closer categorically, as being a casino operator or as being an active trader on the exchanges.\\nIt is argued, however, that a full-time gambler is not offering goods or his services, within the line of demarcation that Justice Frankfurter would have drawn in Du Pont.\\nRespondent replies that he indeed is supplying goods and services, not only to himself but, as well, to the gambling market; thus, he says, he comes within the Frankfurter test even if that were to be imposed as the proper measure.\\nIt takes two to gamble.\"\\nBrief for Respondent 3.\\nSurely, one who clearly satisfies the Frankfurter adumbration usually is in a trade or business.\\nBut does it necessarily follow that one who does not satisfy the Frankfurter adumbration is not in a trade or business?\\nOne might well feel that a full-time gambler *34 ought to qualify as much as a full-time trader, [12] as Justice Brandeis in Snyder implied and as courts have held. [13]\\nThe Commissioner, indeed, accepts the trader result.\\nTr. of Oral Arg. 17.\\nIn any event, while the offering of goods and services usually would qualify the activity as a trade or business, this factor, it seems to us, is not an absolute prerequisite.\\nWe are not satisfied that the Frankfurter gloss would add any helpful dimension to the resolution of cases such as this one, or that it provides a \"sensible test,\" as the Commissioner urges.\\nSee Brief for Petitioner 36.\\nIt might assist now and then, when the answer is obvious and positive, but it surely is capable of breeding litigation over the meaning of \"goods,\" the meaning of \"services,\" or the meaning of \"holding one\\'s self out.\"\\nAnd we suspect that \\x97 apart from gambling \\x97 almost every activity would satisfy the gloss. [14]\\nA test that everyone passes is not a test at all.\\nWe therefore now formally reject the Frankfurter gloss which the Court has never adopted anyway.\\n35 Of course, not every income-producing and profit-making endeavor constitutes a trade or business.\\nThe income tax law, almost from the beginning, has distinguished between a business or trade, on the one hand, and \"transactions entered into for profit but not connected with . . . business or trade,\" on the other.\\nSee Revenue Act of 1916, § 5(a), Fifth, 39 Stat. 759.\\nCongress \"distinguished the broad range of income or profit producing activities from those satisfying the narrow category of trade or business.\"\\nWhipple v. Commissioner, 373 U. S., at 197.\\nWe accept the fact that to be engaged in a trade or business, the taxpayer must be involved in the activity with continuity and regularity and that the taxpayer\\'s primary purpose for engaging in the activity must be for income or profit.\\nA sporadic activity, a hobby, or an amusement diversion does not qualify.\\nIt is suggested that we should defer to the position taken by the Commissioner and by the Solicitor General, but, in the absence of guidance, for over several decades now, through the medium of definitive statutes or regulations, we see little reason to do so.\\nWe would defer, instead, to the Code\\'s normal focus on what we regard as a common-sense concept of what is a trade or business.\\nOtherwise, as here, in the context of a minimum tax, it is not too extreme to say that the taxpayer is being taxed on his gambling losses, [15] a result distinctly out of line with the Code\\'s focus on income.\\nWe do not overrule or cut back on the Court\\'s holding in Higgins when we conclude that if one\\'s gambling activity is pursued full time, in good faith, and with regularity, to the production of income for a livelihood, and is not a mere hobby, it is a trade or business within the meaning of the statutes with which we are here concerned.\\nRespondent *36 Groetzinger satisfied that test in 1978.\\nConstant and largescale effort on his part was made.\\nSkill was required and was applied.\\nHe did what he did for a livelihood, though with a less-than-successful result.\\nThis was not a hobby or a passing fancy or an occasional bet for amusement.\\nWe therefore adhere to the general position of the Higgins Court, taken 46 years ago, that resolution of this issue \"requires an examination of the facts in each case.\"\\n312 U.S., at 217 .\\nThis may be thought by some to be a less-than-satisfactory solution, for facts vary.\\nSee Boyle, What is a Trade or Business?, 39 Tax Lawyer 737, 767 (1986);\\nNote, The Business of Betting: Proposals for Reforming the Taxation of Business Gamblers, 38 Tax Lawyer 759 (1985);\\nLopez, Defining \"Trade or Business\" Under the Internal Revenue Code: A Survey of Relevant Cases, 11 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 949 (1984).\\nCf. Comment, Continuing Vitality of the \"Goods or Services\" Test, 15 U. Balt. L. Rev. 108 (1985).\\nBut the difficulty rests in the Code\\'s wide utilization in various contexts of the term \"trade or business,\" in the absence of an all-purpose definition by statute or regulation, and in our concern that an attempt judicially to formulate and impose a test for all situations would be counterproductive, unhelpful, and even somewhat precarious for the overall integrity of the Code.\\nWe leave repair or revision, if any be needed, which we doubt, to the Congress where we feel, at this late date, the ultimate responsibility rests.\\nCf. Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258 , 269-285 (1972). [16]\\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\\nIt is so ordered.\\n', 'MR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nSection 8 (b) (1) (B) of the National Labor Relations Act, 61 Stat. 141, 29 U.S. C. § 158 (b) (1) (B), makes it an unfair labor practice for a union \"to restrain or coerce . . . an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.\"\\nThe respondent unions in these consolidated cases called economic strikes against the employer companies.\\nDuring the strikes, supervisory employees of the companies, some of whom were members of bargaining units and some of whom were not, but all of whom were union members, crossed *792 the picket lines and performed rank-and-file struck work, i. e., work normally performed by the nonsupervisory employees then on strike.\\nThe unions later disciplined these supervisors for so doing.\\nThe question to be decided is whether the unions committed unfair labor practices under § 8 (b) (1) (B) when they disciplined their supervisor-members for crossing the picket lines and performing rank-and-file struck work during lawful economic strikes against the companies.\\nSince 1909, Local 134, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO, one of the respondents in No. 73-795, has been recognized by the Illinois Bell Telephone Co. (Illinois Bell) and its predecessors as the exclusive bargaining representative for both rank-and-file and certain supervisory personnel, including general foremen, P. B. X. installation foremen, and building cable foremen.\\nRather than exercise its right to refuse to hire union members as supervisors, the company agreed to the inclusion of a union security clause in the collective-bargaining agreement which required that these supervisors, like the rank-and-file employees, maintain membership in Local 134.\\nIn addition, the bargaining agreement in effect at the time of this dispute contained provisions for the conditions of employment and certain wages of these foremen.\\nOther higher ranking supervisors, however, were neither represented by the union for collective-bargaining purposes nor covered by the agreement, although they were permitted to maintain their union membership. [1]\\n793 By virtue of that membership, these supervisors, like those within the bargaining units, received substantial benefits, including participation in the International\\'s pension and death-benefit plans and in group life insurance and old-age-benefit plans sponsored by Local 134.\\nUnder the International\\'s constitution, all union members could be penalized for committing any of 23 enumerated offenses, including \"[w]orking in the interest of any organization or cause which is detrimental to, or opposed to, the I. B. E. W.,\" App. 76, and \"[w]orking for any individual or company declared in difficulty with a [local union] or the I. B. E. W.\"\\nId., at 77.\\nBetween May 8, 1968, and September 20, 1968, Local 134 engaged in an economic strike against the company.\\nAt the inception of the strike, Illinois Bell informed its supervisory personnel that it would like to have them come to work during the stoppage but that the decision whether or not to do so would be left to each individual, and that those who chose not to work would not be penalized.\\nLocal 134, on the other hand, warned its supervisor-members that they would be subject to disciplinary action if they performed rank-and-file work during the strike.\\nSome of the supervisor-members crossed the union picket lines to perform rank-and-file struck work.\\nLocal 134 thereupon initiated disciplinary proceedings against these supervisors, and those found guilty were *794 fined $500 each. [2]\\nCharges were then filed with the NLRB by the Bell Supervisors Protective Association, an association formed by five supervisors to obtain counsel for and otherwise protect the supervisors who worked during the strike.\\nThe Board, one member dissenting, held that in thus disciplining the supervisory personnel, the union had violated § 8 (b) (1) (B) of the Act, [3] in accord with its decision of the same day in Local 2150, IBEW (Wisconsin Electric Power Co.), 192 N. L. R. B. 77 (1971), enforced, 486 F.2d 602 (CA7 1973), cert. pending No. 73-877, holding:\\n\"The Union\\'s fining of the supervisors who were acting in the Employer\\'s interest in performing the struck work severely jeopardized the relationship between the Employer and its supervisors.\\n192 N. L. R. B., at 78.\\nAccordingly, the Board ordered the unions to rescind the fines, to expunge all records thereof, and to reimburse the supervisors for any portions of the fines paid.\\nThe Florida Power & Light Co. (Florida Power), the petitioner in No. 73-556, has maintained a collective-bargaining agreement with the International *795 Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO and Locals 641, 622, 759, 820, and 1263, represented by the System Council U-4, [4] since 1953.\\nThat agreement does not require employees to become union members as a condition of employment, but many of its supervisory personnel have in fact joined the union.\\nThe company has elected to recognize the union as the exclusive bargaining representative of these supervisors, and certain aspects of their wages and conditions of employment are provided for in the agreement. [5]\\nIn addition, other higher supervisory personnel not covered by the agreement were allowed to maintain union membership, [6] and, although not represented by the union for collective-bargaining purposes, received substantial benefits as a result of their union membership, including pension, disability, and death benefits under the terms of the International\\'s constitution.\\nSince the same International union was involved in both No. 73-556 and No. 73-795, the union members of Florida Power bore the same obligations under the International\\'s constitution as did the union members of Illinois Bell.\\nSee supra, at 793.\\nWith respect to union discipline of supervisor members, however, the Florida Power collective-bargaining agreement itself provided:\\n\"It is further agreed that employees in [supervisory] classifications have definite management responsibilities and are the direct representatives of the Company at their level of work. Employees in these classifications and any others in a supervisory capacity are not to be jacked up or disciplined through Union machinery for the acts they may have performed as supervisors in the Company\\'s interest. The Union and the Company do not expect or intend for Union members to interfere with the proper and legitimate performance of the Foreman\\'s management responsibilities appropriate to their classification. . . .\"\\nApp. 47.\\nFrom October 22, 1969, through December 28, 1969, the International union and its locals engaged in an economic strike against Florida Power.\\nDuring the strike, many of the supervisors who were union members crossed the picket lines maintained at nearly all the company\\'s operation facilities, and performed rank-and-file work normally performed by the striking nonsupervisory employees.\\nFollowing the strike, the union brought charges against those supervisors covered by the bargaining agreement as well as those not covered, alleging violations of the International union constitution.\\nThose found guilty of crossing the picket lines to perform rank-and-file work, as opposed to their usual supervisory functions, received fines ranging from $100 to $6,000 and most were expelled from the union, thereby *797 terminating their right to pension, disability, and death benefits.\\nUpon charges filed by Florida Power, the Board, in reliance upon its prior decisions in Wisconsin Electric and Illinois Bell, held that the penalties imposed \"struck at the loyalty an employer should be able to expect from its representatives for the adjustment of grievances and therefore restrained and coerced employers in their selection of such representatives,\" in violation of § 8 (b) (1) (B) of the Act.\\nAccordingly, the Board ordered the union to cease and desist, to rescind and refund all fines, to expunge all records of the disciplinary proceedings, and to restore those disciplined to full union membership and benefits. [7]\\nThe Illinois Bell case was first heard by a panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 159 U. S. App. D. C. 242, 487 F.2d 1113 (1973), and then on rehearing was consolidated with Florida Power and considered en banc.\\nIn a 5-4 decision, the court held that \"[s]ection 8 (b) (1) (B) cannot reasonably be read to prohibit discipline of union members\\x97supervisors though they be\\x97for performance of rank-and-file struck work,\" 159 U. S. App. D. C. 272, 300, 487 F.2d 1143, 1171 (1973), and accordingly refused to enforce the Board\\'s orders. [8]\\nSection 8 (b) (1) (B), the court held, was intended to proscribe only union efforts to discipline supervisors for their actions in representing management in collective bargaining and the adjustment of grievances.\\nIt was the court\\'s view that when a supervisor forsakes his supervisory role to do work normally performed by nonsupervisory employees, he no longer acts as a managerial representative and hence \"no longer merits any immunity from discipline.\"\\nId., at 286, 487 F.2d, at 1157.\\nWe granted *798 certiorari, 414 U.S. 1156,\\nto consider an important and novel question of federal labor law.\\nSection 8 (b) of the National Labor Relations Act provides in pertinent part:\\n\"It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents\\x97(1) to restrain or coerce . . . (B) an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.\"\\nThe basic import of this provision was explained in the Senate Report as follows:\\n\"[A] union or its responsible agents could not, without violating the law, coerce an employer into joining or resigning from an employer association which negotiates labor contracts on behalf of its members; also, this subsection would not permit a union to dictate who shall represent an employer in the settlement of employee grievances, or to compel the removal of a personnel director or supervisor who has been delegated the function of settling grievances.\" [9]\\nFor more than 20 years after § 8 (b) (1) (B) was enacted in 1947, the Board confined its application to situations clearly falling within the metes and bounds of the statutory language.\\nThus, in Los Angeles Cloak Joint Board ILGWU (Helen Rose Co.), 127 N. L. R. B. 1543 (1960), the Board held that § 8 (b) (1) (B) barred a union from picketing a company in an attempt to force the employer to dismiss an industrial relations consultant thought to be hostile to the union.\\nSee also Local *799 986, Miscellaneous Warehousemen, Drivers & Helpers (Tak-Trak, Inc.), 145 N. L. R. B. 1511 (1964); Southern California Pipe Trades District Council No. 16 (Paddock Pools of California, Inc.), 120 N. L. R. B. 249 (1958).\\nSimilarly, the Board held that § 8 (b) (1) (B) was violated by union attempts to force employers to join or resign from multi-employer bargaining associations, United Slate, Tile & Composition Roofers, Local 36 (Roofing Contractors Assn. of Southern California), 172 N. L. R. B. 2248 (1968); Orange Belt District Council of Painters No. 48 (Painting & Decorating Contractors of America, Inc.), 152 N. L. R. B. 1136 (1965); General Teamsters Local Union No. 324 (Cascade Employers Assn., Inc.), 127 N. L. R. B. 488 (1960), as well as by attempts to compel employers to select foremen from the ranks of union members, International Typographical Union & Baltimore Typographical Union No. 12 (Graphic Arts League), 87 N. L. R. B. 1215 (1949); International Typographical Union (American Newspaper Publishers Assn.), 86 N. L. R.

B. 806 (1959), enforced, 278 F.2d 6 (CA1 1960), aff\\'d by an equally divided Court, 365 U.S. 705 (1961). [10]\\nIn 1968, however, the Board significantly expanded the reach of § 8 (b) (1) (B), with its decision in San Francisco-Oakland *800 Mailers\\' Union No. 18 (Northwest Publications, Inc.), 172 N. L. R. B. 2173.\\nIn that case, three union-member foremen were expelled from the union for allegedly assigning bargaining unit work in violation of the collective-bargaining agreement.\\nDespite the absence of union pressure or coercion aimed at securing the replacement of the foremen, the Board held that the union had violated § 8 (b) (1) (B) by seeking to influence the manner in which the foremen interpreted the contract:\\n\"That Respondent may have sought the substitution of attitudes rather than persons, and may have exerted its pressures upon the Charging Party by indirect rather than direct means, cannot alter the ultimate fact that pressure was exerted here for the purpose of interfering with the Charging Party\\'s control over its representatives. Realistically, the Employer would have to replace its foremen or face de facto nonrepresentation by them.\"\\n172 N. L. R. B. 2173.\\nSubsequent Board decisions extended § 8 (b) (1) (B) to proscribe union discipline of management representatives both for the manner in which they performed their collective-bargaining and grievance-adjusting functions, and for the manner in which they performed other supervisory functions if those representatives also in fact possessed authority to bargain collectively or to adjust grievances.\\nSee Detroit Newspaper Printing Pressmen\\'s Union 13, 192 N.

B. 1072 (1969), enforced, 437 F.2d 55 (CA6 1971). [11]\\nThese decisions reflected a further evolution of the Oakland Mailers doctrine.\\nIn Oakland Mailers, the union had disciplined its supervisor-members for an alleged misinterpretation or misapplication of the collective-bargaining agreement,\\nand the Board had reasoned that the natural and foreseeable effect of such discipline was that in interpreting the agreement in the future, the supervisor would be reluctant to take a position adverse to that of the union.\\nIn the subsequent cases, *802 however, the Board held that the same coercive effect was likely to arise from the disciplining of a supervisor whenever he was engaged in management or supervisory activities, even though his collective-bargaining or grievance-adjustment duties were not involved.\\nThrough the course of these decisions, § 8 (b) (1) (B) thus began to evolve in the view of the Board and the courts \"as a general prohibition of a union\\'s disciplining supervisor-members for their conduct in the course of representing the interests of their employers.\"\\nToledo Locals Nos. 15-P & 272, Lithographers & Photoengravers International, 175 N. L. R. B., at 1080, or for acts \"performed in the course of [their] management duties,\" Meat Cutters Union Local 81 v. NLRB, 147 U. S. App. D. C., at 377, 458 F.2d, at 796 . [12]\\nIn the present cases, the Board has extended that doctrine to hold that § 8 (b) (1) (B) forbids union discipline of supervisors for performance of rank-and-file work on the theory that the performance of such work during a strike is an activity furthering management\\'s interests. [13]\\n*803 We agree with the Court of Appeals that § 8 (b) (1) (B) cannot be so broadly read.\\nBoth the language and the legislative history of § 8 (b) (1) (B) reflect a clearly focused congressional concern with the protection of employers in the selection of representatives to engage in two particular and explicitly stated activities, namely collective bargaining and the adjustment of grievances.\\nBy its terms, the statute proscribes only union restraint or coercion of an employer \"in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances,\"\\nand the legislative history makes clear that in enacting the provision Congress was exclusively concerned with union attempts to dictate to employers who would represent them in collective bargaining and grievance adjustment.\\nThe specific concern of Congress was to prevent unions from trying to force employers into or out of multi-employer bargaining units. [14]\\nAs Senator Taft, cosponsor of the legislation, explained:\\n\"Under this provision it would be impossible for a union to say to a company, `We will not bargain with you unless you appoint your national employers\\' association as your agent so that we can bergain nationally.\\' Under the bill the employer has a right to say, `No, I will not join in national bargaining. Here is my representative, and this is the man you have to deal with.\\' I believe the provision is a necessary one, and one which will accomplish substantially wise purposes.\"\\n93 Cong. Rec. 3837.\\n*804 That the legislative creation of this unfair labor practice was in no sense intended to cut the broad swath attributed to it by the Board in the present cases is pointed up by the further observation of Senator Taft\\n\"This unfair labor practice referred to is not perhaps of tremendous importance, but employees cannot say to their employer, `we do not like Mr. X, we will not meet Mr. X. You have to send us Mr. Y.\\' That has been done. It would prevent their saying to the employer, `You have to fire Foreman Jones. We do not like Foreman Jones, and therefore you will have to fire him, or we will not go to work.\\' \"\\n93 Cong. Rec. 3837. [15]\\nNowhere in the legislative history is there to be found any implication that Congress sought to extend protection to the employer from union restraint or coercion when engaged in any activity other than the selection of its representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining and grievance adjustment.\\nThe conclusion is thus inescapable that a union\\'s discipline of one of its members who is a supervisory employee can constitute a violation of § 8 (b) (1) (B) only when that discipline may *805 adversely affect the supervisor\\'s conduct in performing the duties of, and acting in his capacity as, grievance adjuster or collective bargainer on behalf of the employer.\\nWe may assume without deciding that the Board\\'s Oakland Mailers decision fell within the outer limits of this test, but its decisions in the present cases clearly do not.\\nFor it is certain that these supervisors were not engaged in collective bargaining or grievance adjustment, or in any activities related thereto, when they crossed union picket lines during an economic strike to engage in rank-and-file struck work. [16]\\nIt is strenuously asserted, however, that to permit a union to discipline supervisor-members for performing *806 rank-and-file work during an economic strike will deprive the employer of the full loyalty of those supervisors.\\nIndeed, it is precisely that concern that is reflected in these and other recent decisions of the Board holding that the statutory language \"restrain or coerce . . . an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances\" is not confined to situations in which the union\\'s object is to force a change in the identity of the employer\\'s representatives, but may properly be read to encompass any situation in which the union\\'s actions are likely to deprive the employer of the undivided loyalty of his supervisory employees.\\nAs the Board stated in Wisconsin Electric:\\n\"During the strike of the Union, the Employer clearly considered its supervisors among those it could depend on during this period. The Union\\'s fining of the supervisors who were acting in the Employer\\'s interest in performing the struck work severely jeopardized the relationship between the Employer and its supervisors. Thus, the fines, if found to be lawful, would now permit the Union to drive a wedge between a supervisor and the Employer, thus interfering with the performance of the duties the Employer had a right to expect the supervisor to perform. The Employer could no longer count on the complete and undivided loyalty of those it had selected to act as its collective-bargaining agents or to act for it in adjusting grievances. Moreover, such fines clearly interfere with the Employer\\'s control over its own representatives. \"The purpose of Section 8 (b) (1) (B) is to assure to the employer that its selected collective-bargaining representatives will be completely faithful to its desires. This cannot be achieved if the union has an *807 effective method, union disciplinary action, by which it can pressure such representatives to deviate from the interests of the employer.\"\\n192 N. L. R. B., at 78.\\nThe Board in the present cases echoes this view in arguing that \"where a supervisor is disciplined by the union for performing other supervisory or management functions, the likely effect of such discipline is to make him subservient to the union\\'s wishes when he performs those functions in the future.\\nThus, even if the effect of this discipline did not carry over to the performance of the supervisor\\'s grievance adjustment or collective bargaining functions, the result would be to deprive the employer of the full allegiance of, and control over, a representative he has selected for grievance adjustment or collective bargaining purposes.\"\\nBrief for Petitioner in No. 73-795, p. 34.\\nThe concern expressed in this argument is a very real one,\\nbut the problem is one that Congress addressed, not through § 8 (b) (1) (B), but through a completely different legislative route.\\nSpecifically, Congress in 1947 amended the definition of \"employee\" in § 2 (3), 29 U.S. C. § 152 (3), to exclude those denominated supervisors under § 2 (11), 29 U.S. C. § 152 (11), thereby excluding them from the coverage of the Act. [17]\\nSee *808 NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267 (1974).\\nFurther, Congress enacted § 14 (a), 29 U.S. C. § 164 (a), explicitly providing:\\n\"Nothing herein shall prohibit any individual employed as a supervisor from becoming or remaining a member of a labor organization, but no employer subject to this subchapter shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law, either national or local, relating to collective bargaining.\"\\nThus, while supervisors are permitted to become union members, Congress sought to assure the employer of the loyalty of his supervisors by reserving in him the right to refuse to hire union members as supervisors\\nsee Carpenters District Council v. NLRB, 107 U. S. App. D. C. 55, 274 F.2d 564 (1959);\\nA. H. Bull S. S. Co. v. National Marine Engineers\\' Beneficial Assn., 250 F.2d 332 (CA2 1957),\\nsee also Oil City Brass Works v. NLRB, 357 F.2d 466 (CA5 1966);\\nNLRB v. Fullerton Publishing Co., 283 F.2d 545 (CA9 1960);\\nNLRB v. Griggs Equipment, Inc., 307 F.2d 275 (CA5 1962);\\nNLRB v. Edward G. Budd Mfg. Co., 169 F.2d 571 (CA6 1948),\\nand the right to refuse to engage in collective bargaining with them,\\nThe legislative history of §§ 2 (3) and 14 (a) of the Act clearly indicates that those provisions were enacted in response to the decision in Packard Motor Car Co. v. NLRB, 330 U.S. 485 (1947), in which this Court upheld the Board\\'s finding that the statutory definition of \"employee\" included foremen, and that they were therefore entitled to the coverage of the Act in the absence of a decision by Congress to exclude them. [19\\nIn recommending passage of this legislation, the Senate Report noted:\\n\"It is natural to expect that unless this Congress *810 takes action, management will be deprived of the undivided loyalty of its foremen. There is an inherent tendency to subordinate their interests wherever they conflict with those of the rank and file.\"\\nSenate Report 5. (Emphasis supplied.)\\nA similar concern with this conflict-of-loyalties problem was reflected in the House Report:\\n\"The evidence before the committee shows clearly that unionizing supervisors under the Labor Act is inconsistent with . . . our policy to protect the rights of employers; they, as well as workers, are entitled to loyal representatives in the plants, but when the foremen unionize, even in a union that claims to be `independent\\' of the union of the rank and file, they are subject to influence and control by the rank and file union, and, instead of their bossing the rank and file, the rank and file bosses them. ..... \"The bill does not forbid anyone to organize. It does not forbid any employer to recognize a union of foremen. Employers who, in the past, have bargained collectively with supervisors may continue to do so. What the bill does is to say what the law always has said until the Labor Board, in the exercise of what it modestly calls its `expertness\\', changed the law: That no one, whether employer or employee, need have as his agent one who is obligated to those on the other side, or one whom, for any reason, *811 he does not trust.\"\\nHouse Report 14-17. [20] (Emphasis supplied.)\\nIt is clear that the conflict-of-loyalties problem that the Board has sought to reach under § 8 (b) (1) (B) was intended by Congress to be dealt with in a very different manner. [21\\nAs we concluded in Beasley v. Food Fair of North Carolina, Inc., 416 U. S., at 661-662:\\n\"This history compels the conclusion that Congress\\' dominant purpose in amending §§ 2 (3) and 2 (11), and enacting § 14 (a) was to redress a perceived imbalance in labor-management relationships that was found to arise from putting supervisors in the position of serving two masters with opposed interests.\"\\nWhile we recognize that the legislative accommodation adopted in 1947 is fraught with difficulties of its own, \"[i]t is not necessary for us to justify the policy of Congress. It is enough that we find it in the statute.\"\\nColgate-Palmolive *812 Peet Co. v. NLRB, 338 U.S. 355 , 363 (1949). [22]\\nCongress\\' solution was essentially one of providing the employer with an option.\\nOn the one hand, he is at liberty to demand absolute loyalty from his supervisory personnel by insisting, on pain of discharge, that they neither participate in, nor retain membership in, a labor union, see Beasley v. Food Fair of North Carolina, Inc., *813 supra.\\nBut it is quite apparent, given the statutory language and the particular concerns that the legislative history shows were what motivated Congress to enact § 8 (b) (1) (B), that it did not intend to make that provision any part of the solution to the generalized problem of supervisor-member conflict of loyalties.\\nFor these reasons, we hold that the respondent unions did not violate § 8 (b) (1) (B) of the Act when they disciplined their supervisor-members for performing rank-and-file struck work.\\nAccordingly, the judgment is Affirmed.\\n', 'MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nAppellant was convicted in Georgia of the crime of distributing obscene material.\\nHis conviction, in March 1972, was for showing the film \"Carnal Knowledge\" in a movie theater in Albany, Georgia.\\nThe jury that found appellant guilty was instructed on obscenity pursuant to the Georgia statute, which defines obscene material in language similar to that of the definition of obscenity set forth in this Court\\'s plurality opinion in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413 , 418 (1966):\\n\"Material is obscene if considered as a whole, applying community standards, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid *155 interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and utterly without redeeming social value and if, in addition, it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in describing or representing such matters.\" Ga. Code Ann. § 26-2101 (b) (1972). [1]\\nGa. Code Ann. § 26-2101 (b) (1972). [1]\\nWe hold today in Hamling v. United States, ante, p. 87, that defendants convicted prior to the announcement of our Miller decisions but whose convictions were on direct appeal at that time should receive any benefit available to them from those decisions.\\nWe conclude here that the film \"Carnal Knowledge\" is not obscene under the constitutional standards announced in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), and that the First and Fourteenth Amendments therefore require that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia affirming appellant\\'s conviction be reversed.\\nAppellant was the manager of the theater in which \"Carnal Knowledge\" was being shown.\\nWhile he was exhibiting the film on January 13, 1972, local law enforcement officers seized it pursuant to a search warrant.\\nAppellant was later charged by accusation, Ga. Code Ann. § 27-704 (1972), with the offense of distributing obscene material. [2]\\nAfter his trial in the Superior Court of Dougherty *156 County, the jury, having seen the film and heard testimony, returned a general verdict of guilty on March 23, 1972. [3]\\nAppellant was fined $750 and sentenced to 12 months\\' probation.\\nHe appealed to the Supreme Court of Georgia, which by a divided vote affirmed the judgment of conviction on July 2, 1973.\\nThat court stated that the definition of obscenity contained in the Georgia statute was \"considerably more restrictive\" than the new test set forth in the recent case of Miller v. California, supra , and that the First Amendment does not protect the commercial exhibition of \"hard core\" pornography.\\nThe dissenting Justices, in addition to other disagreements with the court, thought that \"Carnal Knowledge\" was entitled to the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\\nAppellant then appealed *157 to this Court\\nand we noted probable jurisdiction, 414 U.S. 1090 (1973).\\nWe agree with the Supreme Court of Georgia\\'s implicit ruling that the Constitution does not require that juries be instructed in state obscenity cases to apply the standards of a hypothetical statewide community.\\nMiller approved the use of such instructions;\\nit did not mandate their use.\\nWhat Miller makes clear is that state juries need not be instructed to apply \"national standards.\"\\nWe also agree with the Supreme Court of Georgia\\'s implicit approval of the trial court\\'s instructions directing jurors to apply \"community standards\" without specifying what \"community.\"\\nMiller held that it was constitutionally permissible to permit juries to rely on the understanding of the community from which they came as to contemporary community standards, and the States have considerable latitude in framing statutes under this element of the Miller decision.\\nA State may choose to define an obscenity offense in terms of \"contemporary community standards\" as defined in Miller without further specification, as was done here, or it may choose to define the standards in more precise geographic terms, as was done by California in Miller.\\nWe now turn to the question of whether appellant\\'s exhibition of the film was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, a question which appellee asserts is not properly before us because appellant did not raise it on his state appeal.\\nBut whether or not appellant argued this constitutional issue below, it is clear that the Supreme Court of Georgia reached and decided it.\\nThat is sufficient under our practice.\\nRaley v. Ohio, 360 U.S. 423 , 436 (1959).\\nWe also note that the trial court instructed the jury on charges other than the distribution charge. [4]\\nHowever, the jury returned a general verdict *158 and appellee does not suggest that appellant\\'s conviction can be sustained on these alternative grounds.\\nCf. Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359 , 367-368 (1931).\\nThere is little to be found in the record about the film \"Carnal Knowledge\" other than the film itself. [5]\\nHowever, appellant has supplied a variety of information and critical commentary, the authenticity of which appellee does not dispute.\\nThe film appeared on many \"Ten Best\" lists for 1971, the year in which it was released.\\nMany but not all of the reviews were favorable.\\nWe believe that the following passage from a review which appeared in the Saturday Review is a reasonably accurate description of the film:\\n\"[It is basically a story] of two young college men, roommates and lifelong friends forever preoccupied with their sex lives. Both are first met as virgins. Nicholson is the more knowledgeable and attractive of the two; speaking colloquially, he is a burgeoning bastard. Art Garfunkel is his friend, the nice but troubled guy straight out of those early Feiffer cartoons, but real. He falls in love with the lovely Susan (Candice Bergen) and unknowingly shares her with his college buddy. As the `safer\\' one of the two, he is selected by Susan for marriage. \"The time changes. Both men are in their thirties, pursuing successful careers in New York. Nicholson has been running through an average of a dozen women a year but has never managed to meet the right one, the one with the full bosom, the good legs, *159 the properly rounded bottom. More than that, each and every one is a threat to his malehood and peace of mind, until at last, in a bar, he finds Ann-Margret, an aging bachelor girl with striking cleavage and, quite obviously, something of a past. `Why don\\'t we shack up?\\' she suggests. They do and a horrendous relationship ensues, complicated mainly by her paranoidal desire to marry. Meanwhile, what of Garfunkel? The sparks have gone out of his marriage, the sex has lost its savor, and Garfunkel tries once more. And later, even more foolishly, again.\" [6]\\nAppellee contends essentially that under Miller the obscenity vel non of the film \"Carnal Knowledge\" was a question for the jury, and that the jury having resolved the question against appellant, and there being some evidence to support its findings, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed.\\nWe turn to the language of Miller to evaluate appellee\\'s contention.\\nMiller states that the questions of what appeals to the \"prurient interest\" and what is \"patently offensive\" under the obscenity test which it formulates are \"essentially questions of fact.\"\\n413 U.S., at 30 .\\n\"When triers of fact are asked to decide whether `the average person, applying contemporary community standards\\' would consider certain materials `prurient\\' it would be unrealistic to require that the answer be based on some abstract formulation. . . . To require a State to structure obscenity proceedings around evidence of a national `community standard\\' would be an exercise in futility.\"\\nIbid.\\nWe held in Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49 (1973), decided on the same day, that expert testimony *160 as to obscenity is not necessary when the films at issue are themselves placed in evidence.\\nId., at 56.\\nBut all of this does not lead us to agree with the Supreme Court of Georgia\\'s apparent conclusion that the jury\\'s verdict against appellant virtually precluded all further appellate review of appellant\\'s assertion that his exhibition of the film was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\\nEven though questions of appeal to the \"prurient interest\" or of patent offensiveness are \"essentially questions of fact,\" it would be a serious misreading of Miller to conclude that juries have unbridled discretion in determining what is \"patently offensive.\"\\nNot only did we there say that \"the First Amendment values applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment are adequately protected by the ultimate power of appellate courts to conduct an independent review of constitutional claims when necessary,\" 413 U.S., at 25, but we made it plain that under that holding \"no one will be subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene materials unless these materials depict or describe patently offensive `hard core\\' sexual conduct . . . .\"\\nId., at 27.\\nWe also took pains in Miller to \"give a few plain examples of what a state statute could define for regulation under part (b) of the standard announced,\" that is, the requirement of patent offensiveness.\\nId., at 25.\\nThese examples included \"representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated,\" and \"representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.\"\\nIbid\\nWhile this did not purport to be an exhaustive catalog of what juries might find patently offensive, it was certainly intended to fix substantive constitutional limitations, deriving from the First Amendment, on the type of material subject to such a *161 determination.\\nIt would be wholly at odds with this aspect of Miller to uphold an obscenity conviction based upon a defendant\\'s depiction of a woman with a bare midriff, even though a properly charged jury unanimously agreed on a verdict of guilty.\\nOur own viewing of the film satisfies us that \"Carnal Knowledge\" could not be found under the Miller standards to depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way.\\nNothing in the movie falls within either of the two examples given in Miller of material which may constitutionally be found to meet the \"patently offensive\" element of those standards, nor is there anything sufficiently similar to such material to justify similar treatment.\\nWhile the subject matter of the picture is, in a broader sense, sex, and there are scenes in which sexual conduct including \"ultimate sexual acts\" is to be understood to be taking place, the camera does not focus on the bodies of the actors at such times.\\nThere is no exhibition whatever of the actors\\' genitals, lewd or otherwise, during these scenes.\\nThere are occasional scenes of nudity, but nudity alone is not enough to make material legally obscene under the Miller standards.\\nAppellant\\'s showing of the film \"Carnal Knowledge\" is simply not the \"public portrayal of hard core sexual conduct for its own sake, and for the ensuing commercial gain\" which we said was punishable in Miller. Id., at 35.\\nWe hold that the film could not, as a matter of constitutional law, be found to depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and that it is therefore not outside the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it is obscene.\\nNo other basis appearing in the record upon which the judgment of conviction can be sustained, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia.\\nReversed.\\n', 'MR. JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nThe question presented by the Secretary\\'s appeal is whether Congress may condition an alien\\'s eligibility for participation in a federal medical insurance program on continuous residence in the United States for a five-year period and admission for permanent residence.\\nThe District Court held that the first condition was unconstitutional and that it could not be severed from the second.\\nSince we conclude that both conditions are constitutional, we reverse.\\nEach of the appellees is a resident alien who was lawfully admitted to the United States less than five years ago.\\nAppellees Diaz and Clara are Cuban refugees who remain in this country at the discretion of the Attorney General;\\nappellee Espinosa has been admitted for permanent *70 residence.\\nAll three are over 65 years old and have been denied enrollment in the Medicare Part B supplemental medical insurance program established by § 1831 et seq. of the Social Security Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 620, as added, 79 Stat. 301, and as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 1395j et seq. (1970 ed. and Supp. IV). [1]\\nThey brought this action to challenge the statutory basis for that denial.\\nSpecifically, they attack 42 U. S. C. § 1395o (2) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), which grants eligibility to resident citizents who are 65 or older but denies eligibility to comparable aliens unless they have been admitted for permanent residence and also have resided in the United States for at least five years. [2]\\nAppellees Diaz and Clara meet neither requirement;\\nappellee Espinosa meets only the first.\\nOn August 18, 1972, Diaz filed a class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern *71 District of Florida alleging that his application for enrollment had been denied on the ground that he was not a citizen and had neither been admitted for permanent residence nor resided in the United States for the immediately preceding five years.\\nHe further alleged that numerous other persons had been denied enrollment in the Medicare Part B program for the same reasons.\\nHe sought relief on behalf of a class of persons who have been or will denied enrollment in the Medicare insurance program for failure to meet the requirements of 42 U. S. C. § 1395o (2) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).\\nSince the complaint prayed for a declaration that § 1395o (2) was unconstitutional and for an injunction requiring the Secretary to approve all applicants who had been denied eligibility solely for failure to comply with its requirements, a three-judge court was constituted.\\nOn September 28, 1972, the District Court granted leave to add Clara and Espinosa as plaintiffs and to file an amended complaint.\\nThat pleading alleged that Clara had been denied enrollment for the same reasons as Diaz, but explained that Espinosa, although a permanent resident since 1971, had not attempted to enroll because he could not meet the durational residence requirement, and therefore any attempt would have been futile.\\nThe amended complaint sought relief on behalf of a subclass represented by Espinosa\\x97that is, aliens admitted for permanent residence who have been or will be denied enrollment for failure to meet the five-year continuous residence requirement\\x97as well as relief on behalf of the class represented by Diaz and Clara. [3]\\n*72 On October 24, 1972, the Secretary moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground, among others, that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter because none of the plaintiffs had exhausted his administrative remedies under the Social Security Act.\\nTwo days later, on October 26, 1972, Espinosa filed his application for enrollment with the Secretary.\\nHe promptly brought this fact to the attention of the District Court, without formally supplementing the pleadings.\\nNone of the appellees completely exhausted available avenues for administrative review.\\nNevertheless, the *73 Secretary acknowledged that the applications of Diaz and Clara raised no disputed issues of fact and therefore the interlocutory denials of their applications should be treated as final for the purpose of this litigation.\\nThis satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of 42 U. S. C. § 405 (g).\\nWeinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749 , 763-767;\\nWeinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636 , 641 n. 8.\\nThe Secretary did not make an equally unambiguous concession with respect to Espinosa, but in colloquy with the court he acknowledged that Espinosa had filed an application which could not be allowed under the statute. [4]\\nThe District Court overruled the Secretary\\'s motion to dismiss and decided the merits on cross-motions for summary judgment.\\nThe District Court held that the five-year residence requirement violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment [5] and that since it could not be severed from the requirement of admission for permanent residence, the alien-eligibility provisions of § 1395o (2) (B) were entirely unenforceable.\\nDiaz v. Weinberger, 361 F. Supp. 1 (1973).\\nThe District Court reasoned that \"even though fourteenth amendment notions of equal protection are not entirely congruent with fifth amendment concepts of due process,\" id., at 9, the danger of unjustifiable discrimination against aliens in the enactment of welfare programs is so great, in view of their complete lack of representation in the political process, that this federal statute should be tested under the same pledge of equal protection as a state statute.\\nSo tested, the court concluded that the statute was invalid because it was not both rationally based and free from invidious discrimination.\\nIt rejected the desire to preserve the fiscal *74 integrity of the program, or to treat some aliens as less deserving than others, as adequate justification for the statute.\\nAccordingly, the court enjoined the Secretary from refusing to enroll members of the class and subclass represented by appellees.\\nThe Secretary appealed directly to this Court. [6]\\nWe noted probable jurisdiction.\\nWeinberger v. Diaz, 416 U. S. 980.\\nAfter hearing argument last Term, we set the case for reargument. 420 U. S. 959.\\n420 U. S. 959.\\nWe now consider (1) whether the District Court had jurisdiction over Espinosa\\'s claim; (2) whether Congress may discriminate in favor of citizens and against aliens in providing welfare benefits; and (3) if so, whether the specific discriminatory provisions in § 1395o (2) (B) are constitutional.\\nEspinosa\\'s claim squarely raises the question whether the requirement of five years\\' continuous residence is constitutional, a question that is not necessarily presented by the claims of Diaz and Clara.\\nFor if the requirement of admission for permanent residence is valid, their applications were properly denied even if the durational residence requirement is ineffective. [7]\\nWe *75 must therefore decide whether the District Court had jurisdiction over Espinosa\\'s claim.\\nWe have little difficulty with Espinosa\\'s failure to file an application with the Secretary until after he was joined in the action.\\nAlthough 42 U. S. C. § 405 (g) establishes filing of an application as a nonwaivable condition of jurisdiction, Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 , 328; Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S., at 764 , Espinosa satisfied this condition while the case was pending in the District Court.\\nA supplemental complaint in the District Court would have eliminated this jurisdictional issue; [8]\\nsince the record discloses, both by affidavit and stipulation, that the jurisdictional condition was satisfied, it is not too late, even now, to supplement the complaint to allege this fact. [9]\\nUnder these circumstances, we treat the pleadings as properly supplemented by the Secretary\\'s stipulation that Espinosa had filed an application.\\nA further problem is presented by the absence of any formal administrative action by the Secretary denying Espinosa\\'s application.\\nSection 405 (g) requires a final decision by the Secretary after a hearing as a prerequisite of jurisdiction.\\nMathews v. Eldridge, supra, at 328-330;\\nWeinberger v. Salfi, supra, at 763-765\\nHowever, *76 we held in Salfi that the Secretary could waive the exhaustion requirements which this provision contemplates and that he had done so in that case.\\nId., at 765-767;\\naccord, Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, at 328-330 (dictum);\\nWeinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S., at 641 n. 8.\\nWe reach a similar conclusion here.\\nThe plaintiffs in Salfi alleged that their claims had been denied by the local and regional Social Security offices and that the only question was one of constitutional law, beyond the competence of the Secretary to decide.\\nThese allegations did not satisfy the exhaustion requirements of § 405 (g) or the Secretary\\'s regulations, but the Secretary failed to challenge the sufficiency of the allegations on this ground.\\nWe interpreted this failure as a determination by the Secretary that exhaustion would have been futile and deferred to his judgment that the only issue presented was the constitutionality of a provision of the Social Security Act.\\nThe same reasoning applies to the present case.\\nAlthough the Secretary moved to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, at the hearing on the motion he stipulated that no facts were in dispute, that the case was ripe for disposition by summary judgment, and that the only issue before the District Court was the constitutionality of the statute. [10]\\nAs in Salfi, this constitutional question is beyond the Secretary\\'s competence.\\nIndeed, the Secretary has twice stated in this Court that he stipulated in the District Court that Espinosa\\'s application would be denied for failure to meet the durational residence requirement. [11]\\nFor jurisdictional purposes, we *77 treat the stipulation in the District Court as tantamount to a decision denying the application and as a waiver of the exhaustion requirements.\\nCf. Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, supra, at 640 n. 6, 641 n. 8.\\nWe conclude, as we did in Salfi, that the Secretary\\'s submission of the question for decision on the merits by the District Court satisfied the statutory requirement of a hearing and final decision.\\nWe hold that Espinosa\\'s claim, as well as the claims of Diaz and Clara, must be decided.\\nThere are literally millions of aliens within the jurisdiction of the United States.\\nThe Fifth Amendment, as well as the Fourteenth Amendment, protects every one of these persons from deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\\nWong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33 , 48-51;\\nWong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228 , 238;\\nsee Russian Fleet v. United States, 282 U. S. 481 , 489.\\nEven one whose presence in this country is unlawful, involuntary, or transitory is entitled to that constitutional protection.\\nWong Yang Sung, supra\\nWong Wing, supra .\\n*78 The fact that all persons, aliens and citizens alike, are protected by the Due Process Clause does not lead to the further conclusion that all aliens are entitled to enjoy all the advantages of citizenship or, indeed, to the conclusion that all aliens must be placed in a single homogeneous legal classification.\\nFor a host of constitutional and statutory provisions rest on the premise that a legitimate distinction between citizens and aliens may justify attributes and benefits for one class not accorded to the other; [12]\\nand the class of aliens is itself a heterogeneous *79 multitude of persons with a wide-ranging variety of ties to this country. [13]\\nIn the exercise of its broad power over naturalization *80 and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.\\nThe exclusion of aliens [14] and the reservation of the power to deport [15] have no permissible counterpart in the Federal Government\\'s power to regulate the conduct of its own citizenry. [16]\\nThe fact that an Act of Congress treats aliens differently from citizens does not in itself imply that such disparate treatment is \"invidious.\"\\nIn particular, the fact that Congress has provided some welfare benefits for citizens does not require it to provide like benefits for all aliens.\\nNeither the overnight visitor, the unfriendly agent of a hostile foreign power, the resident diplomat, nor the illegal entrant, can advance even a colorable constitutional claim to a share in the bounty that a conscientious sovereign makes available to its own citizens and some of its guests.\\nThe decision to share that bounty with our guests may take into account the character of the relationship between the alien and this country:\\nCongress may decide that as the alien\\'s tie grows stronger, so does the strength of his claim to an equal share of that munificence.\\nThe real question presented by this case is not whether discrimination between citizens and aliens is permissible;\\nrather, it is whether the statutory discrimination within the class of aliens\\x97allowing benefits to some aliens but not to others\\x97is permissible.\\nWe turn to that question.\\nFor reasons long recognized as valid, the responsibility for regulating the relationship between the United States and our alien visitors has been committed to the political branches of the Federal Government. [17]\\nSince decisions in these matters may implicate our relations with foreign powers, and since a wide variety of classifications must be defined in the light of changing political and economic circumstances, such decisions are frequently of a character more appropriate to either the Legislature or the Executive than to the Judiciary.\\nThis very case illustrates the need for flexibility in policy choices rather than the rigidity often characteristic of constitutional adjudication.\\nAppellees Diaz and Clara are but two of over 440,000 Cuban refugees who arrived in the United States between 1961 and 1972. [18]\\nAnd the Cuban parolees are but one of several categories of aliens who have been admitted in order to make a humane response to a natural catastrophe or an international political situation. [19]\\nAny rule of constitutional law that would inhibit the flexibility of the political branches of government to respond to changing world conditions should be adopted only with the greatest caution. [20]\\nThe reasons *82 that preclude judicial review of political questions [21] also dictate a narrow standard of review of decisions made by the Congress or the President in the area of immigration and naturalization.\\nSince it is obvious that Congress has no constitutional duty to provide all aliens with the welfare benefits provided to citizens, the party challenging the constitutionality of the particular line Congress has drawn has the burden of advancing principled reasoning that will at once invalidate that line and yet tolerate a different line separating some aliens from others.\\nIn this case the appellees have challenged two requirements\\x97first, that the alien be admitted as a permanent resident, and, second, that his residence be of a duration of at least five years.\\nBut if these requirements were eliminated, surely Congress would at least require that the alien\\'s entry be lawful;\\neven then, unless mere transients are to be held constitutionally entitled to benefits, some durational requirement would certainly be appropriate.\\nIn short, it *83 is unquestionably reasonable for Congress to make an alien\\'s eligibility depend on both the character and the duration of his residence.\\nSince neither requirement is wholly irrational, this case essentially involves nothing more than a claim that it would have been more reasonable for Congress to select somewhat different requirements of the same kind.\\nWe may assume that the five-year line drawn by Congress is longer than necessary to protect the fiscal integrity of the program. [22]\\nWe may also assume that unnecessary hardship is incurred by persons just short of qualifying.\\nBut it remains true that some line is essential, that any line must produce some harsh and apparently arbitrary consequences, and, of greatest importance, that those who qualify under the test Congress has chosen may reasonably be presumed to have a greater affinity with the United States than those who do not.\\nIn short, citizens and those who are most like citizens qualify.\\nThose who are less like citizens do not.\\nThe task of classifying persons for medical benefits, like the task of drawing lines for federal tax purposes, inevitably requires that some persons who have an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be placed on different sides of the line;\\nthe differences between the *84 eligible and the ineligible are differences in degree rather than differences in the character of their respective claims.\\nWhen this kind of policy choice must be made, we are especially reluctant to question the exercise of congressional judgment. [23]\\nIn this case, since appellees have not identified a principled basis for prescribing a different standard than the one selected by Congress, they have, in effect, merely invited us to substitute our judgment for that of Congress in deciding which aliens shall be eligible to participate in the supplementary insurance program on the same conditions as citizens.\\nWe decline the invitation.\\nThe cases on which appellees rely are consistent with our conclusion that this statutory classification does not deprive them of liberty or property without due process of law.\\nGraham v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 365 , provides the strongest support for appellees\\' position.\\nThat case holds that state statutes that deny welfare benefits to resident aliens, or to aliens not meeting a requirement of durational residence within the United States, violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and encroach upon the exclusive federal power over the entrance and residence of aliens.\\nOf course, the latter ground of decision actually supports our holding today that it is the business of the political branches of the Federal Government, rather than that of either the States or the Federal Judiciary, to regulate the conditions of entry and residence of aliens. The equal protection analysis also involves significantly different considerations because it concerns the relationship between *85 aliens and the States rather than between aliens and the Federal Government.\\nInsofar as state welfare policy is concerned, [24] there is little, if any, basis for treating persons who are citizens of another State differently from persons who are citizens of another country.\\nBoth groups are noncitizens as far as the State\\'s interests in administering its welfare programs are concerned.\\nThus, a division by a State of the category of persons who are not citizens of that State into subcategories of United States citizens and aliens has no apparent justification, whereas, a comparable classification by the Federal Government is a routine and normally legitimate part of its business.\\nFurthermore, whereas the Constitution inhibits every State\\'s power to restrict travel across its own borders, Congress is explicitly empowered to exercise that type of control over travel across the borders of the United States. [25]\\nThe distinction between the constitutional limits on state power and the constitutional grant of power to the Federal Government also explains why appellees\\' reliance on Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U. S. 250 , is misplaced.\\nThat case involved Arizona\\'s requirement of durational residence within a county in order to receive nonemergency medical care at the *86 county\\'s expense.\\nNo question of alienage was involved.\\nSince the sole basis for the classification between residents impinged on the constitutionally guaranteed right to travel within the United States, the holding in Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618 , required that it be justified by a compelling state interest. [26]\\nFinding no such justification, we held that the requirement violated the Equal Protection Clause.\\nThis case, however, involves no state impairment of the right to travel\\x97nor indeed any impairment whatever of the right to travel within the United States; the predicate for the equal protection analysis in those cases is simply not present.\\nContrary to appellees\\' characterization, it is not \"political hypocrisy\" to recognize that the Fourteenth Amendment\\'s *87 limits on state powers are substantially different from the constitutional provisions applicable to the federal power over immigration and naturalization.\\nFinally, we reject the suggestion that U. S. Dept. of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U. S. 528 , lends relevant support to appellees\\' claim.\\nNo question involving alienage was presented in that case.\\nRather, we found that the denial of food stamps to households containing unrelated members was not only unsupported by any rational basis but actually was intended to discriminate against certain politically unpopular groups.\\nThis case involves no impairment of the freedom of association of either citizens or aliens.\\nWe hold that § 1395o (2) (B) has not deprived appellees of liberty or property without due process of law.\\nThe judgment of the District Court is Reversed.\\n', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nThe Sixth Amendment, applicable to the States by the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that the ac- cused shall have the assistance of counsel in all criminal prosecutions.\\nThe right to counsel is the right to effective assistance of counsel.\\nSee Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 , 686 (1984).\\nThis case arises in the context of claimed ineffective assistance that led to the lapse of a prosecution offer of a plea bargain, a proposal that offered terms more lenient than the terms of the guilty plea en- tered later.\\nThe initial question is whether the consti- tutional right to counsel extends to the negotiation and consideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected.\\nIf there is a right to effective assistance with respect to those offers, a further question is what a defendant must dem- onstrate in order to show that prejudice resulted from counsel’s deficient performance.\\nOther questions relating to ineffective assistance with respect to plea offers, includ- ing the question of proper remedies, are considered in a second case decided today.\\nSee Lafler v. Cooper, post, at 3–16. ?2\\nIn August 2007, respondent Galin Frye was charged with driving with a revoked license.\\nFrye had been con- victed for that offense on three other occasions, so the State of Missouri charged him with a class D felony, which carries a maximum term of imprisonment of four years.\\nSee Mo. Rev. Stat. §§302.321.2 , 558.011.1(4) (2011).\\nOn November 15, the prosecutor sent a letter to Frye’s counsel offering a choice of two plea bargains.\\nApp. 50.\\nThe prosecutor first offered to recommend a 3-year sen- tence if there was a guilty plea to the felony charge, with- out a recommendation regarding probation but with a recommendation that Frye serve 10 days in jail as so- called “shock” time.\\nThe second offer was to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor and, if Frye pleaded guilty to it, to recommend a 90-day sentence.\\nThe misdemeanor charge of driving with a revoked license carries a maxi- mum term of imprisonment of one year.\\n311 S. W. 3d 350 , 360 (Mo. App. 2010).\\nThe letter stated both offers would expire on December 28.\\nFrye’s attorney did not advise Frye that the offers had been made.\\nThe offers expired.\\nId., at 356 .\\nFrye’s preliminary hearing was scheduled for January 4, 2008.\\nOn December 30, 2007, less than a week before the hearing, Frye was again arrested for driving with a re- voked license.\\nApp. 47–48, 311 S. W. 3d, at 352–353.\\nAt the January 4 hearing, Frye waived his right to a prelimi- nary hearing on the charge arising from the August 2007 arrest.\\nHe pleaded not guilty at a subsequent arraign- ment but then changed his plea to guilty.\\nThere was no underlying plea agreement.\\nApp. 5, 13, 16.\\nThe state trial court accepted Frye’s guilty plea.\\nId., at 21.\\nThe prosecu- tor recommended a 3-year sentence, made no recommen- dation regarding probation, and requested 10 days shock time in jail.\\nId., at 22.\\nThe trial judge sentenced Frye to three years in prison.\\nId., at 21, 23.\\nFrye filed for postconviction relief in state court.\\nId., at 8, 25–29.\\nHe alleged his counsel’s failure to inform him of the prosecution’s plea offer denied him the effective assis- tance of counsel.\\nAt an evidentiary hearing, Frye testified he would have entered a guilty plea to the misdemeanor had he known about the offer.\\nId., at 34.\\nA state court denied the postconviction motion,\\nid., at 52–57,\\nbut the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed,\\n311 S. W. 3d 350 .\\nIt determined that Frye met both of the requirements for showing a Sixth Amendment violation under Strickland.\\nFirst, the court determined Frye’s counsel’s performance was deficient because the “record is void of any evidence of any effort by trial counsel to com- municate the Offer to Frye during the Offer window.”\\n311 S. W. 3d, at 355, 356 (emphasis deleted).\\nThe court next concluded Frye had shown his counsel’s deficient perfor- mance caused him prejudice because “Frye pled guilty to a felony instead of a misdemeanor and was subject to a maximum sentence of four years instead of one year.”\\nId., at 360 .\\nTo implement a remedy for the violation, the court deemed Frye’s guilty plea withdrawn and remanded to allow Frye either to insist on a trial or to plead guilty to any offense the prosecutor deemed it appropriate to charge.\\nThis Court granted certiorari.\\nIt is well settled that the right to the effective assistance of counsel applies to certain steps before trial.\\nThe “Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to have counsel present at all ‘critical’ stages of the criminal pro- ceedings.”\\nMontejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778 , 786 (2009) (quoting United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218 , 227–228 (1967)).\\nCritical stages include arraignments, postindictment interrogations, postindictment lineups, and the entry of a guilty plea.\\nSee Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52 (1961) (arraignment);\\nMassiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201 (1964) (postindictment interrogation);\\nWade, supra (postindictment lineup);\\nArgersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25 (1972) (guilty plea).\\nWith respect to the right to effective counsel in plea negotiations, a proper beginning point is to discuss two cases from this Court considering the role of counsel in advising a client about a plea offer and an ensuing guilty plea:\\nHill v. Lockhart, 474 U. S. 52 (1985);\\nand Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___(2010).\\nHill established that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in the plea bargain context are governed by the two-part test set forth in Strickland.\\nSee Hill, supra, at 57 .\\nAs noted above, in Frye’s case, the Missouri Court of Appeals, applying the two part test of Strickland, deter- mined first that defense counsel had been ineffective and second that there was resulting prejudice.\\nIn Hill, the decision turned on the second part of the Strickland test.\\nThere, a defendant who had entered a guilty plea claimed his counsel had misinformed him of the amount of time he would have to serve before he be- came eligible for parole.\\nBut the defendant had not al- leged that, even if adequate advice and assistance had been given, he would have elected to plead not guilty and proceed to trial.\\nThus, the Court found that no prejudice from the inadequate advice had been shown or alleged.\\nHill, supra, at 60.\\nIn Padilla, the Court again discussed the duties of counsel in advising a client with respect to a plea offer that leads to a guilty plea.\\nPadilla held that a guilty plea, based on a plea offer, should be set aside because counsel misinformed the defendant of the immigration conse- quences of the conviction.\\nThe Court made clear that “the negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical phase of litigation for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to effec- tive assistance of counsel.”\\n559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).\\nIt also rejected the argument made by petitioner in this case that a knowing and voluntary plea supersedes errors by defense counsel.\\nCf. Brief for Respondent in Padilla v. Kentucky, O. T. 2009, No. 08–651, p. 27\\n(arguing Sixth Amendment’s assurance of effective assistance “does not extend to collateral aspects of the prosecution” because “knowledge of the consequences that are collateral to the guilty plea is not a prerequisite to the entry of a knowing and intelligent plea”).\\nIn the case now before the Court the State, as petitioner, points out that the legal question presented is different from that in Hill and Padilla.\\nIn those cases the claim was that the prisoner’s plea of guilty was invalid because counsel had provided incorrect advice pertinent to the plea.\\nIn the instant case, by contrast, the guilty plea that was accepted, and the plea proceedings concerning it in court, were all based on accurate advice and information from counsel.\\nThe challenge is not to the advice pertain- ing to the plea that was accepted but rather to the course of legal representation that preceded it with respect to other potential pleas and plea offers.\\nTo give further support to its contention that the instant case is in a category different from what the Court consid- ered in Hill and Padilla, the State urges that there is no right to a plea offer or a plea bargain in any event.\\nSee Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545 , 561 (1977).\\nIt claims Frye therefore was not deprived of any legal benefit to which he was entitled.\\nUnder this view, any wrongful or mistaken action of counsel with respect to earlier plea offers is beside the point.\\nThe State is correct to point out that Hill and Padilla concerned whether there was ineffective assistance lead- ing to acceptance of a plea offer, a process involving a formal court appearance with the defendant and all counsel present.\\nBefore a guilty plea is entered the defendant’s understanding of the plea and its consequences can be established on the record.\\nThis affords the State substan- tial protection against later claims that the plea was the result of inadequate advice.\\nAt the plea entry proceedings the trial court and all counsel have the opportunity to establish on the record that the defendant understands the process that led to any offer, the advantages and disadvantages of accepting it, and the sentencing conse- quences or possibilities that will ensue once a conviction is entered based upon the plea.\\nSee, e.g., Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11; \\nMo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02 (2004).\\nHill and Padilla both illustrate that, nevertheless, there may be instances when claims of ineffective assistance can arise after the conviction is entered.\\nStill, the State, and the trial court itself, have had a substantial opportunity to guard against this contingency by establishing at the plea entry proceed- ing that the defendant has been given proper advice or, if the advice received appears to have been inadequate, to remedy that deficiency before the plea is accepted and the conviction entered.\\nWhen a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected, however, no formal court proceedings are involved.\\nThis under- scores that the plea-bargaining process is often in flux, with no clear standards or timelines and with no judicial supervision of the discussions between prosecution and defense.\\nIndeed, discussions between client and defense counsel are privileged.\\nSo the prosecution has little or no notice if something may be amiss and perhaps no capacity to intervene in any event.\\nAnd, as noted, the State insists there is no right to receive a plea offer.\\nFor all these reasons, the State contends, it is unfair to subject it to the consequences of defense counsel’s inadequacies, especially when the opportunities for a full and fair trial, or, as here, for a later guilty plea albeit on less favorable terms, are preserved.\\nThe State’s contentions are neither illogical nor without some persuasive force, yet they do not suffice to overcome a simple reality.\\nNinety-seven percent of federal con- victions and ninety-four percent of state convictions are the result of guilty pleas.\\nSee Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Sta- tistics Online, Table 5.22.2009, http://www.albany.edu/ sourcebook/pdf/t5222009.pdf (all Internet materials as visited Mar. 1, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file);\\nDept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, S.

Moore, 562 U.

Glover v. United States, 531 U. S. 198 , 203 (2001)\\n(“[A]ny amount of [additional] jail time has Sixth Amendment significance”).\\nThis application of Strickland to the instances of an uncommunicated, lapsed plea does nothing to alter the standard laid out in Hill.\\nIn cases where a defendant complains that ineffective assistance led him to accept a plea offer as opposed to proceeding to trial, the defendant will have to show “a reasonable probability that, but for  counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.”\\nHill, 474 U. S., at 59 .\\nHill was correctly decided and applies in the context in which it arose.\\nHill does not, however, provide the sole means for demonstrating prejudice arising from the defi- cient performance of counsel during plea negotiations.\\nUnlike the defendant in Hill, Frye argues that with effec- tive assistance he would have accepted an earlier plea offer (limiting his sentence to one year in prison) as op- posed to entering an open plea (exposing him to a maxi- mum sentence of four years’ imprisonment).\\nIn a case, such as this, where a defendant pleads guilty to less fa- vorable terms and claims that ineffective assistance of counsel caused him to miss out on a more favorable earlier plea offer, Strickland’s inquiry into whether “the result of the proceeding would have been different,” 466 U. S., at 694 , requires looking not at whether the defendant would have proceeded to trial absent ineffective assistance but whether he would have accepted the offer to plead pursu- ant to the terms earlier proposed.\\nIn order to complete a showing of Strickland prejudice, defendants who have shown a reasonable probability they would have accepted the earlier plea offer must also show that, if the prosecution had the discretion to cancel it or if the trial court had the discretion to refuse to accept it, there is a reasonable probability neither the prosecution nor the trial court would have prevented the offer from being accepted or implemented.\\nThis further showing is of particular importance because a defendant has no right to be offered a plea,\\nIn at least some States, including Missouri, it appears the prosecution has some discretion to cancel a plea agreement to which the defend- ant has agreed, see, e.g.,\\n311 S. W. 3d, at 359 (case below); Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 17.4(b) (Supp. 2011).\\nThe Federal Rules, some state rules including in Missouri, and this Court’s precedents give trial courts some leeway to accept or reject plea agreements,\\nsee Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(3);\\nsee Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02(d)(4);\\nBoykin v. Ala- bama, 395 U. S. 238 , 243–244 (1969).\\nIt can be assumed that in most jurisdictions prosecutors and judges are familiar with the boundaries of acceptable plea bargains and sentences.\\nSo in most instances it should not be difficult to make an objective assessment as to whether or not a particular fact or intervening circumstance would suffice, in the normal course, to cause prosecutorial with- drawal or judicial nonapproval of a plea bargain.\\nThe determination that there is or is not a reasonable probabil- ity that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different absent counsel’s errors can be conducted within that framework.\\nThese standards must be applied to the instant case.\\nAs regards the deficient performance prong of Strickland, the Court of Appeals found the “record is void of any evidence of any effort by trial counsel to communicate the [formal] Offer to Frye during the Offer window, let alone any evi- dence that Frye’s conduct interfered with trial counsel’s ability to do so.”\\n311 S. W. 3d, at 356 .\\nOn this record, it is evident that Frye’s attorney did not make a meaningful attempt to inform the defendant of a written plea offer before the offer expired.\\nSee supra, at 2.\\nThe Missouri Court of Appeals was correct that “counsel’s representa- tion fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” Strickland,\\nThe Court of Appeals erred, however, in articulating the precise standard for prejudice in this context.\\nAs noted, a defendant in Frye’s position must show not only a reason- able probability that he would have accepted the lapsed plea but also a reasonable probability that the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement and that it would have been accepted by the trial court.\\nFrye can show he would have accepted the offer, but there is strong reason to doubt the prosecution and the trial court would have permitted the plea bargain to become final.\\nThere appears to be a reasonable probability Frye would have accepted the prosecutor’s original offer of a plea bargain if the offer had been communicated to him, be- cause he pleaded guilty to a more serious charge, with no promise of a sentencing recommendation from the prose- cutor.\\nIt may be that in some cases defendants must show more than just a guilty plea to a charge or sentence harsh- er than the original offer.\\nFor example, revelations be- tween plea offers about the strength of the prosecution’s case may make a late decision to plead guilty insufficient to demonstrate, without further evidence, that the defend- ant would have pleaded guilty to an earlier, more gener- ous plea offer if his counsel had reported it to him.\\nHere, however, that is not the case.\\nThe Court of Appeals did not err in finding Frye’s acceptance of the less favorable plea offer indicated that he would have accepted the earli- er (and more favorable) offer had he been apprised of it; and there is no need to address here the showings that might be required in other cases.\\nThe Court of Appeals failed, however, to require Frye to show that the first plea offer, if accepted by Frye, would have been adhered to by the prosecution and accepted by the trial court.\\nWhether the prosecution and trial court are required to do so is a matter of state law,\\nand it is not the place of this Court to settle those matters.\\nThe Court has established the minimum requirements of the Sixth Amendment as interpreted in Strickland,\\nand States have the discretion to add procedural protections under state law if they choose.\\nA State may choose to preclude the prosecution from withdrawing a plea offer once it has been accepted or perhaps to preclude a trial court from rejecting  a plea bargain.\\nIn Missouri, it appears “a plea offer once accepted by the defendant can be withdrawn without re- course” by the prosecution.\\n311 S. W. 3d, at 359 .\\nThe ex- tent of the trial court’s discretion in Missouri to reject a plea agreement appears to be in some doubt.\\nCompare id., at 360 , with Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 24.02(d)(4).\\nWe remand for the Missouri Court of Appeals to consid- er these state-law questions, because they bear on the federal question of Strickland prejudice.\\nIf, as the Mis- souri court stated here, the prosecutor could have canceled the plea agreement, and if Frye fails to show a reasonable probability the prosecutor would have adhered to the agreement, there is no Strickland prejudice.\\nLikewise, if the trial court could have refused to accept the plea agreement, and if Frye fails to show a reasonable probabil- ity the trial court would have accepted the plea, there is no Strickland prejudice.\\nIn this case, given Frye’s new of- fense for driving without a license on December 30, 2007, there is reason to doubt that the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement or that the trial court would have accepted it at the January 4, 2008, hearing, unless they were required by state law to do so.\\nIt is appropriate to allow the Missouri Court of Appeals to address this question in the first instance.\\nThe judg- ment of the Missouri Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\\nIt is so ordered.\\n', 'MR. JUSTICE BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nIn these cases an employer insisted that its collective-bargaining contract with certain of its employees include: (1) a \"ballot\" clause calling for a pre-strike secret vote of those employees (union and nonunion) as to the employer\\'s last offer, and (2) a \"recognition\" clause which excluded, as a party to the contract, the International Union which had been certified by the National Labor Relations Board as the employees\\' exclusive bargaining *344 agent, and substituted for it the agent\\'s uncertified local affiliate.\\nThe Board held that the employer\\'s insistence upon either of such clauses amounted to a refusal to bargain, in violation of § 8 (a) (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended. [1]\\nThe issue turns on whether either of these clauses comes within the scope of mandatory collective bargaining as defined in § 8 (d) of the Act. [2]\\nFor the reasons hereafter stated, we agree with the Board that neither clause comes within that definition.\\nTherefore, we sustain the Board\\'s order directing the employer to cease insisting upon either clause as a condition precedent to accepting any collective-bargaining contract.\\nLate in 1952, the International Union, United Automobile, Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, CIO (here called International) was certified by the Board to the Wooster (Ohio) Division of the Borg-Warner Corporation (here called the company) as the elected representative of an appropriate unit of the company\\'s employees.\\nShortly thereafter, International chartered Local No. 1239, UAW-CIO (here called the Local).\\nTogether the unions presented the company with a comprehensive collective-bargaining agreement.\\nIn the \"recognition\" clause, the unions described themselves as both the \"International Union, *345 United Automobile, Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers of America and its Local Union No. 1239, U. A. W.-C. I. O. . . . .\"\\nThe company submitted a counterproposal which recognized as the sole representative of the employees \"Local Union 1239, affiliated with the International Union, United Automobile, Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW-CIO).\"\\nThe unions\\' negotiators objected because such a clause disregarded the Board\\'s certification of International as the employees\\' representative.\\nThe negotiators declared that the employees would accept no agreement which excluded International as a party.\\nThe company\\'s counterproposal also contained the \"ballot\" clause, quoted in full in the margin. [3]\\nIn summary, *346 this clause provided that, as to all nonarbitrable issues (which eventually included modification, amendment or termination of the contract), there would be a 30-day negotiation period after which, before the union could strike, there would have to be a secret ballot taken among all employees in the unit (union and nonunion) on the company\\'s last offer.\\nIn the event a majority of the employees rejected the company\\'s last offer, the company would have an opportunity, within 72 hours, of making a new proposal and having a vote on it prior to any strike. The unions\\' negotiators announced they would not accept this clause \"under any conditions.\"\\nThe unions\\' negotiators announced they would not accept this clause \"under any conditions.\\nFrom the time that the company first proposed these clauses, the employees\\' representatives thus made it clear *347 that each was wholly unacceptable.\\nThe company\\'s representatives made it equally clear that no agreement would be entered into by it unless the agreement contained both clauses.\\nIn view of this impasse, there was little further discussion of the clauses, although the parties continued to bargain as to other matters.\\nThe company submitted a \"package\" proposal covering economic issues but made the offer contingent upon the satisfactory settlement of \"all other issues . . . .\" The \"package\" included both of the controversial clauses.\\nThe \"package\" included both of the controversial clauses.\\nOn March 15, 1953, the unions rejected that proposal and the membership voted to strike on March 20 unless a settlement were reached by then.\\nNone was reached and the unions struck.\\nNegotiations, nevertheless, continued.\\nOn April 21, the unions asked the company whether the latter would withdraw its demand for the \"ballot\" and \"recognition\" clauses if the unions accepted all other pending requirements of the company.\\nThe company declined and again insisted upon acceptance of its \"package,\" including both clauses.\\nFinally, on May 5, the Local, upon the recommendation of International, gave in and entered into an agreement containing both controversial clauses.\\nIn the meantime, International had filed charges with the Board claiming that the company, by the above conduct, was guilty of an unfair labor practice within the meaning of § 8 (a) (5) of the Act.\\nThe trial examiner found no bad faith on either side.\\nowever, he found that the company had made it a condition precedent to its acceptance of any agreement that the agreement include both the \"ballot\" and the \"recognition\" clauses.\\nFor that reason, he recommended that the company be found guilty of a per se unfair labor practice in violation of § 8 (a) (5).\\nHe reasoned that, because each of the controversial clauses was outside of the scope of mandatory bargaining as defined in § 8 (d) of the Act, the company\\'s *348 insistence upon them, against the permissible opposition of the unions, amounted to a refusal to bargain as to the mandatory subjects of collective bargaining.\\nThe Board, with two members dissenting, adopted the recommendations of the examiner.\\n113 N. L. R. B. 1288, 1298.\\nIn response to the Board\\'s petition to enforce its order, the Court of Appeals set aside that portion of the order relating to the \"ballot\" clause, but upheld the Board\\'s order as to the \"recognition\" clause.\\n236 F.2d 898 .\\nBecause of the importance of the issues and because of alleged conflicts among the Courts of Appeals, [4] we granted the Board\\'s petition for certiorari in No. 53, relating to the \"ballot\" clause, and the company\\'s cross-petition in No. 78, relating to the \"recognition\" clause.\\n353 U.S. 907.\\nWe turn first to the relevant provisions of the statute.\\nSection 8 (a) (5) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \"to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees . . . .\" [5]\\n] Section 8 (d) defines collective bargaining as follows:\\n\"(d) For the purposes of this section, to bargain collectively is the performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder, and the execution of a written contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party, but such obligation does not compel *349 either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession . . . .\"\\n61 Stat. 142, 29 U.S. C. § 158 (d).\\nRead together, these provisions establish the obligation of the employer and the representative of its employees to bargain with each other in good faith with respect to \"wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. . . .\"\\nThe duty is limited to those subjects, and within that area neither party is legally obligated to yield.\\nLabor Board v. American Insurance Co., 343 U.S. 395 .\\nAs to other matters, however, each party is free to bargain or not to bargain, and to agree or not to agree.\\nThe company\\'s good faith has met the requirements of the statute as to the subjects of mandatory bargaining.\\nBut that good faith does not license the employer to refuse to enter into agreements on the ground that they do not include some proposal which is not a mandatory subject of bargaining.\\nWe agree with the Board that such conduct is, in substance, a refusal to bargain about the subjects that are within the scope of mandatory bargaining.\\nThis does not mean that bargaining is to be confined to the statutory subjects.\\nEach of the two controversial clauses is lawful in itself. [6]\\nEach would be enforceable if agreed to by the unions.\\nBut it does not follow that, because the company may propose these clauses, it can lawfully insist upon them as a condition to any agreement.\\nSince it is lawful to insist upon matters within the scope of mandatory bargaining and unlawful to insist upon matters without, the issue here is whether either the \"ballot\" or the \"recognition\" clause is a subject within the phrase \"wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment\" which defines mandatory bargaining.\\nThe \"ballot\" clause is not within that definition.\\nIt relates *350 only to the procedure to be followed by the employees among themselves before their representative may call a strike or refuse a final offer.\\nIt settles no term or condition of employment\\x97it merely calls for an advisory vote of the employees.\\nIt is not a partial \"no-strike\" clause.\\nA \"no-strike\" clause prohibits the employees from striking during the life of the contract.\\nIt regulates the relations between the employer and the employees.\\nSee Labor Board v. American Insurance Co., supra, at 408, n. 22.\\nThe \"ballot\" clause, on the other hand, deals only with relations between the employees and their unions.\\nIt substantially modifies the collective-bargaining system provided for in the statute by weakening the independence of the \"representative\" chosen by the employees.\\nIt enables the employer, in effect, to deal with its employees rather than with their statutory representative.\\nCf. Medo Photo Corp. v. Labor Board, 321 U.S. 678 .\\nThe \"recognition\" clause likewise does not come within the definition of mandatory bargaining.\\nThe statute requires the company to bargain with the certified representative of its employees.\\nIt is an evasion of that duty to insist that the certified agent not be a party to the collective-bargaining contract.\\nhe Act does not prohibit the voluntary addition of a party, but that does not authorize the employer to exclude the certified representative from the contract.\\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals in No. 53 is reversed and the cause remanded for disposition consistent with this opinion. In No. 78, the judgment is affirmed.\\nNo. 53\\x97Reversed and remanded.

S. 555 , 569 (1980), the plurality opinion summarized the evolution of the criminal trial as we know it today and concluded that \"at the time when our organic laws were adopted, criminal trials both here and in England had long been presumptively open.\"\\nA review of the historical evidence is also helpful for present purposes.\\nIt reveals that, since the development of trial by jury, the process of selection of jurors has presumptively been a public process with exceptions only for good cause shown.\\nThe roots of open trials reach back to the days before the Norman Conquest when cases in England were brought before \"moots,\" a town meeting kind of body such as the local court of the hundred or the county court. [1]\\nAttendance was virtually compulsory on the part of the freemen of the community, who represented the \"patria,\" or the \"country,\" in rendering judgment.\\nThe public aspect thus was \"almost a necessary incident of jury trials, since the presence of a jury. . . already insured the presence of a large part of the public.\" [2]\\n*506 As the jury system evolved in the years after the Norman Conquest, and the jury came to be but a small segment representing the community, the obligation of all freemen to attend criminal trials was relaxed;\\nhowever, the public character of the proceedings, including jury selection, remained unchanged.\\nLater, during the 14th and 15th centuries, the jury became an impartial trier of facts, owing in large part to a development in that period, allowing challenges. [3]\\n1 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 332, 335 (7th ed. 1956).\\nSince then, the accused has generally enjoyed the right to challenge jurors in open court at the outset of the trial. [4]\\nAlthough there appear to be few contemporary accounts of the process of jury selection of that day, [5] one early record written in 1565 places the trial \"[i]n the towne house, or in some open or common place.\"\\nT. Smith, De Republica *507 Anglorum 96 (Alston ed. 1906).\\nSmith explained that \"there is nothing put in writing but the enditement\":\\n\"All the rest is doone openlie in the presence of the Judges, the Justices, the enquest, the prisoner, and so many as will or can come so neare as to heare it, and all depositions and witnesses given aloude, that all men may heare from the mouth of the depositors and witnesses what is saide.\"\\nId., at 101 (emphasis added).\\nIf we accept this account it appears that beginning in the 16th century, jurors were selected in public.\\nAs the trial began, the judge and the accused were present.\\nBefore calling jurors, the judge \"telleth the cause of their comming, and [thereby] giveth a good lesson to the people.\"\\nId., at 96-97 (emphasis added).\\nThe indictment was then read; if the accused pleaded not guilty, the jurors were called forward, one by one, at which time the defendant was allowed to make his challenges.\\nId., at 98.\\nSmith makes clear that the entire trial proceeded \"openly, that not only the xii [12 jurors], but the Judges, the parties and as many [others] as be present may heare.\"\\nId., at 79 (emphasis added).\\nThis open process gave assurance to those not attending trials that others were able to observe the proceedings and enhanced public confidence.\\nThe presence of bystanders served yet another purpose according to Blackstone.\\nIf challenges kept a sufficient number of qualified jurors from appearing at the trial, \"either party may pray a tales.\"\\n3 W. Blackstone Commentaries *364;\\nsee also M. Hale, The History of the Common Law of England 342 (6th ed. 1820).\\nA \"tales\" was the balance necessary to supply the deficiency. [6]\\n*508 The presumptive openness of the jury selection process in England, not surprisingly, carried over into proceedings in colonial America.\\nFor example, several accounts noted the need for talesmen at the trials of Thomas Preston and William Wemms, two of the British soldiers who were charged with murder after the so-called Boston Massacre in 1770. [7]\\nPublic jury selection thus was the common practice in America when the Constitution was adopted.\\nFor present purposes, how we allocate the \"right\" to openness as between the accused and the public, or whether we view it as a component inherent in the system benefiting both, is not crucial.\\nNo right ranks higher than the right of the accused to a fair trial.\\nBut the primacy of the accused\\'s right is difficult to separate from the right of everyone in the community to attend the voir dire which promotes fairness.\\nThe open trial thus plays as important a role in the administration of justice today as it did for centuries before our separation from England.\\nThe value of openness lies in the fact that people not actually attending trials can have confidence that standards of fairness are being observed;\\nthe sure knowledge that anyone is free to attend gives assurance that established procedures are being followed and that deviations will become known.\\nOpenness thus enhances both the basic fairness of the criminal trial and the appearance of fairness so essential to public confidence in the system.\\nRichmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U. S., at 569-571 .\\nThis openness has what is sometimes described as a \"community therapeutic value.\"\\nId., at 570.\\nCriminal acts, especially *509 violent crimes, often provoke public concern, even outrage and hostility; this in turn generates a community urge to retaliate and desire to have justice done.\\nthis in turn generates a community urge to retaliate and desire to have justice done.\\nSee T. Reik, The Compulsion to Confess 288-295, 408 (1959).\\nWhether this is viewed as retribution or otherwise is irrelevant.\\nWhen the public is aware that the law is being enforced and the criminal justice system is functioning, an outlet is provided for these understandable reactions and emotions.\\nProceedings held in secret would deny this outlet and frustrate the broad public interest;\\nby contrast, public proceedings vindicate the concerns of the victims and the community in knowing that offenders are being brought to account for their criminal conduct by jurors fairly and openly selected.\\nSee United States v. Hasting, 461 U. S. 499 , 507 (1983);\\nMorris v. Slappy, 461 U. S. 1 , 14-15 (1983).\\n\"People in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.\"\\nRichmond Newspapers, supra, at 572.\\nClosed proceedings, although not absolutely precluded, must be rare and only for cause shown that outweighs the value of openness. [8]\\nIn Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U. S. 596 (1982), we stated:\\n\"[T]he circumstances under which the press and public can be barred from a criminal trial are limited; the State\\'s justification in denying access must be a weighty *510 one. Where . . . the State attempts to deny the right of access in order to inhibit the disclosure of sensitive information, it must be shown that the denial is necessitated by a compelling governmental interest, and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\"\\nId., at 606-607.\\nThe presumption of openness may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\\nThe interest is to be articulated along with findings specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.\\nWe now turn to whether the presumption of openness has been rebutted in this case.\\nAlthough three days of voir dire in this case were open to the public, six weeks of the proceedings were closed, and media requests for the transcript were denied. [9]\\nThe Superior Court asserted two interests in support of its closure order and orders denying a transcript: the right of the defendant to a fair trial, and the right to privacy of the prospective jurors, for any whose \"special experiences in sensitive areas . . . do not appear to be appropriate for public discussion.\"\\nSupra, at 504.\\nOf course the right of an accused to fundamental fairness in the jury selection process is a compelling interest.\\nBut the California court\\'s conclusion that Sixth Amendment and privacy interests were sufficient to warrant prolonged closure was unsupported by findings *511 showing that an open proceeding in fact threatened those interests; [10]\\nhence it is not possible to conclude that closure was warranted. [11]\\nEven with findings adequate to support closure, the trial court\\'s orders denying access to voir dire testimony failed to consider whether alternatives were available to protect the interests of the prospective jurors that the trial court\\'s orders sought to guard.\\nAbsent consideration of alternatives to closure, the trial court could not constitutionally close the voir dire.\\nThe jury selection process may, in some circumstances, give rise to a compelling interest of a prospective juror when interrogation touches on deeply personal matters that person has legitimate reasons for keeping out of the public domain.\\n*512 The trial involved testimony concerning an alleged rape of a teenage girl.\\nSome questions may have been appropriate to prospective jurors that would give rise to legitimate privacy interests of those persons.\\nFor example a prospective juror might privately inform the judge that she, or a member of her family, had been raped but had declined to seek prosecution because of the embarrassment and emotional trauma from the very disclosure of the episode.\\nThe privacy interests of such a prospective juror must be balanced against the historic values we have discussed and the need for openness of the process.\\nTo preserve fairness and at the same time protect legitimate privacy, a trial judge must at all times maintain control of the process of jury selection and should inform the array of prospective jurors, once the general nature of sensitive questions is made known to them, that those individuals believing public questioning will prove damaging because of embarrassment, may properly request an opportunity to present the problem to the judge in camera but with counsel present and on the record.\\nBy requiring the prospective juror to make an affirmative request, the trial judge can ensure that there is in fact a valid basis for a belief that disclosure infringes a significant interest in privacy.\\nThis process will minimize the risk of unnecessary closure.\\nThe exercise of sound discretion by the court may lead to excusing such a person from jury service.\\nWhen limited closure is ordered, the constitutional values sought to be protected by holding open proceedings may be satisfied later by making a transcript of the closed proceedings available within a reasonable time, if the judge determines that disclosure can be accomplished while safeguarding the juror\\'s valid privacy interests.\\nEven then a valid privacy right may rise to a level that part of the transcript should be sealed, or the name of a juror withheld, to protect the person from embarrassment.\\n*513 The judge at this trial closed an incredible six weeks of voir dire without considering alternatives to closure.\\nLater the court declined to release a transcript of the voir dire even while stating that \"most of the information\" in the transcript was \"dull and boring.\"\\nSupra, at 504.\\nThose parts of the transcript reasonably entitled to privacy could have been sealed without such a sweeping order;\\na trial judge should explain why the material is entitled to privacy.\\nAssuming that some jurors had protectible privacy interests in some of their answers, the trial judge provided no explanation as to why his broad order denying access to information at the voir dire was not limited to information that was actually sensitive and deserving of privacy protection.\\nNor did he consider whether he could disclose the substance of the sensitive answers while preserving the anonymity of the jurors involved.\\nThus not only was there a failure to articulate findings with the requisite specificity but there was also a failure to consider alternatives to closure and to total suppression of the transcript.\\nThe trial judge should seal only such parts of the transcript as necessary to preserve the anonymity of the individuals sought to be protected.\\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\\nIt is so ordered.\\n', '*194 MR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nThis is a companion case to Leng May Ma v. Barber, decided today, ante, p. 185.\\nThe five respondents are natives of China who came to the United States seeking admission between 1949 and 1954, four of them arriving before the effective date of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\\nLike petitioner in Leng May Ma, all were paroled into the United States, and all have been ordered excluded.\\nThey applied for stays of deportation under § 243 (h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, [1] and upon refusal, filed complaints in the District Court seeking judgments declaring their nondeportability to China, directing consideration of their claims under § 243 (h), and restraining the Attorney General from deporting them.\\nThe complaints were dismissed by the District Court, but the Court of Appeals held that excluded aliens on parole are \"within the United States\" for purposes of § 243 (h). 101 U.

C. 229, 248 F.2d 89\\nBecause of the conflict with the Ninth Circuit\\'s decision in Leng May Ma,\\nwe granted certiorari.\\n355 U.S. 861 (1957).\\nWe have concluded that respondents, like petitioner in Leng May Ma, are ineligible for stays of deportation under § 243 (h).\\nHowever, because of the importance of this problem in the administration of the immigration laws, we deem it appropriate to deal specifically with a contention not directly asserted by petitioner in Leng May Ma.\\nThe deportation of excluded aliens under the Immigration and Nationality Act is authorized in § 237 (a) of Chapter 4, wherein it is provided that an alien excluded *195 under the Act \"shall be immediately deported to the country whence he came . . . .\" 66 Stat. 201, 8 U.S. C. § 1227 (a).\\n66 Stat. 201, 8 U.S. C. § 1227 (a).\\nA similar provision existed in the immediate predecessor to § 237 (a), which was § 18 of the Immigration Act of 1917. [2]\\nDeportation in expulsion proceedings is separately provided for under the present Act in § 243 of Chapter 5, subsection (h) of which, of course, contains the authority which respondents seek to invoke in this case.\\n66 Stat. 212, 8 U.S. C. § 1253.\\nLike authority existed in the immediate predecessor of § 243, which was § 20 of the Immigration Act of 1917, 39 Stat. 890, as amended by § 23 of the Internal Security Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 1010.\\nRespondents assert, however, that neither § 237 (a) nor its predecessor, § 18 of the 1917 Act, is the basis for their deportation since they were not \"immediately\" deported as required in the sections.\\nHence, they argue that deportation must rest upon § 243 of the present Act, as to the respondent who arrived after the Immigration and Nationality Act, and its predecessor, § 20 of the 1917 Act, as to the four who arrived prior to the present Act.\\nWe will assume, for purpose of analysis, that four of the five respondents are, as they claim, deportable only under prior Acts by virtue of their early arrival.\\nHowever, under neither of the exclusion sections, i. e., § 237 (a) of the present Act or § 18 of the 1917 Act, is the deportation authority confined, as respondents contend, to those situations where deportation is immediate.\\nNeither section, when read in its entirety and in context, fairly suggests any such limitation.\\nNor are there reasons of policy to compel such a result.\\nAs the desire to remain increases, those knocking on our doors quite naturally become more litigious, and contested departures *196 often involve long delays.\\nWe doubt that the Congress intended the mere fact of delay to improve an alien\\'s status from that of one seeking admission to that of one legally considered within the United States.\\nWe conclude that there is ample basis under § 237 (a) and § 18 of the 1917 Act to deport respondents;\\nwe need not draw upon the provisions in § 243 of the present Act or § 20 of the 1917 Act.\\nRegardless of which of the two exclusion sections, § 237 (a) of the 1952 Act or § 18 of the 1917 Act, provides the basis for respondents\\' deportation, the applications for stays were all filed subsequent to the 1952 Act and hence must be determined by that Act.\\nFor reasons explained in Leng May Ma, § 243 (h) is unavailable to excluded aliens, and the fact of parole creates no variance from this principle.\\nReversed.\\n', 'JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\\nIn the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011, 35 U.

Patent No. 6,826,548 (’548 patent), which claims a method for processing mail that is undeliverable.\\nBeginning in 2003, the United States Postal Service allegedly began exploring the possibility of licensing Return Mail’s invention for use in handling the country’s undelivered mail.\\nBut the parties never reached an agreement.\\nIn 2006, the Postal Service introduced an enhanced address-change service to process undeliverable mail.\\nReturn Mail’s representatives asserted that the new ser- vice infringed the ’548 patent,\\nIn response, the Postal Service petitioned for ex parte reexamination of the ’548 patent.\\nThe Patent Office canceled the original claims but issued several new ones, confirming the validity of the ’548 patent.\\nReturn Mail then sued the Postal Service in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking compensation for the Postal Service’s unauthorized use of its invention, as reissued by the Pat- ent Office.\\nWhile the lawsuit was pending, the Postal Service again petitioned the Patent Office to review the ’548 patent, this time seeking CBM review.\\nThe Patent Board instituted review.\\nThe Board agreed with the Postal Service that Return Mail’s patent claims subject matter that was ineli- gible to be patented,\\nand it canceled the claims underlying the ’548 patent.\\nA divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed.\\nSee 868 F. 3d 1350 (2017).\\nAs relevant here, the Federal Circuit held, over a dissent, that the Government is a “person” eligible to petition for CBM review.\\nId., at 1366 ;\\nsee AIA §18(a)(1)(B), 125 Stat. 330\\n(only a qualifying “person” may petition for CBM review)\\nThe court then affirmed the Patent Board’s decision on the merits, invalidating Return Mail’s patent claims.\\nWe granted certiorari\\nto determine whether a federal agency is a “person” capable of petitioning for post- issuance review under the AIA.\\n2 586 U.

United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765 , 780–781 (2000);\\nsee United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258 , 275 (1947);\\nUnited States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U. S. 600 , 603–605 (1941);\\nUnited States v. Fox, 94 U. S. 315 , 321 (1877).\\nThis presumption reflects “common usage.”\\nMine Work- ers, 330 U. S., at 275 .\\nIt is also an express directive from Congress:\\nThe Dictionary Act has since 1947 provided the definition of “ ‘person’ ” that courts use “[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise.”\\n1 U. S. C. §1 ;\\nsee Rowland v. Cali- fornia Men’s Colony, Unit II Men’s Advisory Council, 506 U. S. 194 , 199–200 (1993).\\nThe Act provides that the word “ ‘person’ . . . include[s] corporations, companies, associa- tions, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock com- panies, as well as individuals.”\\n§1.\\nNotably absent from the list of “person[s]” is the Federal Government.\\nSee Mine Workers, 330 U. S., at 275\\n(reasoning that Congress’ express inclusion of partnerships and corporations in §1 implies that Congress did not intend to include the Gov- ernment).\\nThus, although the presumption is not a “hard and fast rule of exclusion,” Cooper, 312 U. S., at 604–605, “it may be disregarded only upon some affirmative show- ing of statutory intent to the contrary,”\\nThe Postal Service contends that the presumption is strongest where interpreting the word “person” to include the Government imposes liability on the Government, and is weakest where (as here) interpreting “person” in that way benefits the Government.\\nIn support of this argu- ment, the Postal Service points to a different interpretive canon:\\nthat Congress must unequivocally express any waiver of sovereign immunity for that waiver to be effec- tive.\\nSee FAA v. Cooper, 566 U. S. 284 , 290 (2012).\\nThat clear-statement rule inherently applies only when a party seeks to hold the Government liable for its actions;\\nother- wise immunity is generally irrelevant.\\nIn the Postal Service’s view, the presumption against treating the Gov- ernment as a statutory person works in tandem with the clear-statement rule regarding immunity, such that both apply only when a statute would subject the Government to liability.\\nOur precedents teach otherwise.\\nIn several instances, this Court has applied the presumption against treating the Government as a statutory person when there was no question of immunity, and doing so would instead exclude the Federal Government or one of its agencies from access- ing a benefit or favorable procedural device.\\nIn Cooper, 312 U. S., at 604–605, 614, for example, the Court held that the Federal Government was not “ ‘[a]ny person’ ” who could sue for treble damages under §7 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.\\nAccord, International Primate Protection League v. Administrators of Tulane Ed. Fund, 500 U. S. 72 , 82–84 (1991)\\n(concluding that the National Institutes of Health was not authorized to remove an action as a “ ‘person acting under [a federal]’ officer” pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §1442 (a)(1));\\nDavis v. Pringle, 268 U. S. 315 , 317– 318 (1925) \\n(reasoning that “normal usages of speech” indicated that the Government was not a “person” entitled to priority under the Bankruptcy Act);\\nFox, 94 U. S., at 321 \\n(holding that the Federal Government was not a “ ‘person capable by law of holding real estate,’ ” absent “an express definition to that effect”).\\nThus, although the presumption against treating the Government as a statutory person is “ ‘particularly appli- cable where it is claimed that Congress has subjected the [sovereign] to liability to which they had not been subject before,’ ” Stevens, 529 U. S., at 781 , it is hardly confined to such cases.\\nHere, too, we proceed from the presumption that the Government is not a “person” authorized to initi- ate these proceedings absent an affirmative showing to the contrary.\\nGiven the presumption that a statutory reference to a “person” does not include the Government, the Postal Service must show that the AIA’s context indicates other- wise.\\nAlthough the Postal Service need not cite to “an express contrary definition,” Rowland, 506 U. S., at 200 , it must point to some indication in the text or context of the statute that affirmatively shows Congress intended to include the Government.\\nSee Cooper, 312 U. S., at 605 .\\nThe Postal Service makes three arguments for displac- ing the presumption.\\nFirst, the Postal Service argues that the statutory text and context offer sufficient evidence that the Government is a “person” with the power to peti- tion for AIA review proceedings.\\nSecond, the Postal Ser- vice contends that federal agencies’ long history of partici- pation in the patent system suggests that Congress intended for the Government to participate in AIA review proceedings as well.\\nThird, the Postal Service maintains that the statute must permit it to petition for AIA review because §1498 subjects the Government to liability for infringement.\\nNone delivers.\\nThe Postal Service first argues that the AIA’s reference to a “person” in the context of post-issuance review pro- ceedings must include the Government because other references to persons in the patent statutes appear to do so.\\nIndeed, it is often true that when Congress uses a word to mean one thing in one part of the statute, it will mean the same thing elsewhere in the statute.\\nSee Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U. S. 71 , 86 (2006).\\nThis principle, however, “readily yields to context,” especially when a statutory term is used throughout a statute and takes on “distinct characters” in distinct statutory provisions.\\nSee Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U. S. 302 , 320 (2014) (internal quota- tion marks omitted).\\nThat is the case here.\\nThe Patent Act and the AIA refer to “person[s]” in at least 18 different places, and there is no clear trend:\\nSometimes “person” plainly includes the Government,3 sometimes it plainly excludes the Government,4 and sometimes—as here—it might be read either way.\\nLooking on the bright side, the Postal Service and the dissent, see post, at 2, focus on §207(a)(1), which authorizes “[e]ach [f]ederal agency” to “apply for, obtain, and main- tain patents or other forms of protection . . . on inventions in which the Federal Government owns a right, title, or interest.”\\nIt follows from §207(a)(1)’s express inclusion of\\nIn other words, the right de- scribed in §207(a)(1) provides a sufficient contextual clue that the word “person”—when used in the other provisions governing the application process §207(a)(1) makes available to federal agencies—includes the Government.\\nBut §207(a)(1) provides no such clue as to the interpre- tation of the AIA review provisions because it implies nothing about what a federal agency may or may not do following the issuance of someone else’s patent.\\nConversely, reading the review provisions to exclude the Govern- ment has no bearing on a federal agency’s right to obtain a patent under §207(a)(1).\\nAn agency may still apply for and obtain patents whether or not it may petition for a review proceeding under the AIA seeking cancellation of a patent it does not own.\\nThere is thus no reason to think that “person” must mean the same thing in these two different parts of the statute.\\nSee Utility Air, 573 U. S., at 320.6\\nThe Postal Service cites other provisions that may refer to the Government—namely, the “intervening rights” provisions that offer certain protections for “any person” who is lawfully making or using an invention when the Patent Office modifies an existing patent claim in a way that deems the person’s (previously lawful) use to be infringement.\\nSee §§252, 307(b), 318(c), 328(c).\\nThe Postal Service argues that the Government must be among those protected by these provisions and from there deduces that it must also be permitted to petition for AIA review proceedings because the review provisions and the intervening-rights provisions were all added to the Patent Act by the AIA at the same time.\\nSee Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551 U. S. 224 , 232 (2007) (invoking the consistent-usage canon where the same term was used in related provisions enacted at the same time).\\n(invoking the consistent-usage canon where the same term was used in related provisions enacted at the same time).\\nBut regardless of whether the intervening-rights provi- sions apply to the Government (a separate interpretive question that we have no occasion to answer here), the Postal Service’s chain of inferences overlooks a confound- ing link:\\nThe consistent-usage canon breaks down where Congress uses the same word in a statute in multiple conflicting ways.\\nAs noted, that is the case here.\\nIn the face of such inconsistency, the mere existence of some Government-inclusive references cannot make the “af- firmative showing,” Stevens, 529 U. S., at 781 , required to overcome the presumption that Congress did not intend to include the Government among those “person[s]” eligible to petition for AIA review proceedings.\\nThe Postal Service next points to the Federal Govern- ment’s longstanding history with the patent system.\\nIt reminds us that federal officers have been able to apply for patents in the name of the United States since 1883, see Act of Mar. 3, 1883, 22 Stat. 625 —which, in the Postal Service’s view, suggests that Congress intended to allow the Government access to AIA review proceedings as well.\\nBut, as already explained, the Government’s ability to obtain a patent under §207(a)(1) does not speak to whether Congress meant for the Government to participate as a third-party challenger in AIA review proceedings.\\nAs to those proceedings, there is no longstanding practice:\\nThe AIA was enacted just eight years ago.\\nMore pertinently, the Postal Service and the dissent both note that the Patent Office since 1981 has treated federal agencies as “persons” who may cite prior art to the agency or request an ex parte reexamination of an issued patent.\\nSee post, at 5.\\nRecall that §301(a) provides that “[a]ny person at any time may cite to the Office in writing . . . prior art . . . which that person believes to have a bearing on the patentability of any claim of a particular patent.”\\nAs memorialized in the Patent Office’s Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP), the agency has understood §301’s reference to “any person” to include “governmental entit[ies].”\\nDept. of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office, MPEP §§2203, 2212 (4th rev. ed., July 1981).\\nWe might take account of this “executive interpretation” if we were determining whether Congress meant to in- clude the Government as a “person” for purposes of the ex parte reexamination procedures themselves.\\nSee, e.g., United States v. Hermanos y Compañia, 209 U. S. 337 , 339 (1908).\\nHere, however, the Patent Office’s statement in the 1981 MPEP has no direct relevance.\\nEven assuming that the Government may petition for ex parte reexamina- tion, ex parte reexamination is a fundamentally different process than an AIA post-issuance review proceeding.\\nBoth share the common purpose of allowing non-patent owners to bring questions of patent validity to the Patent Office’s attention, but they do so in meaningfully different ways.\\nIn an ex parte reexamination, the third party sends information to the Patent Office that the party believes bears on the patent’s validity, and the Patent Office de- cides whether to reexamine the patent.\\nIf it decides to do so, the reexamination process is internal; \\nthe challenger is not permitted to participate in the Patent Office’s process.\\nSee 35 U. S. C. §§302 , 303.\\nBy contrast, the AIA post- issuance review proceedings are adversarial, adjudicatory proceedings between the “person” who petitioned for re- view and the patent owner:\\nThere is briefing, a hearing, discovery, and the presentation of evidence, and the losing party has appeal rights.\\nSee supra, at 4–5.\\nThus, there are good reasons Congress might have authorized the Government to initiate a hands-off ex parte reexamination but not to become a party to a full-blown adversarial proceeding before the Patent Office and any subsequent\\nAfter all, the Government is already in a unique position among alleged infringers given that 28 U. S. C. §1498 limits patent owners to bench trials before the Court of Federal Claims and monetary damages, whereas 35 U. S. C. §271 permits patent owners to demand jury trials in the federal district courts and seek other types of relief.\\nThus, there is nothing to suggest that Congress had the 1981 MPEP statement in mind when it enacted the AIA.\\nIt is true that this Court has often said, “[w]hen adminis- trative and judicial interpretations have settled the mean- ing of an existing statutory provision, repetition of the same language in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its administrative and judicial interpretations as well.”\\nBragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S. 624 , 645 (1998).\\nBut there is no “settled” meaning of the term “person” with respect to the newly established AIA review proceedings.\\nAccordingly, the MPEP does not justify putting aside the presumptive meaning of “person” here.\\nFinally, the Postal Service argues that it must be a “person” who may petition for AIA review proceedings because, like other potential infringers, it is subject to civil liability and can assert a defense of patent invalidity.\\nSee §§282(b)(2)–(3).\\nIn the Postal Service’s view, it is anoma- lous to deny it a benefit afforded to other infringers—the ability to challenge a patent de novo before the Patent Office, rather than only as an infringement defense that must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.\\nSee ibid.; Microsoft Corp., 564 U. S., at 95 (holding that §282’s presumption of validity in litigation imposes a clear and convincing evidence standard on defendants seeking to prove invalidity).\\nSee ibid.; Microsoft Corp., 564 U. S., at 95 (holding that §282’s presumption of validity in litigation imposes a clear and convincing evidence standard on defendants seeking to prove invalidity).\\nThe Postal Service overstates the asymmetry.\\nAgencies retain the ability under §282 to assert defenses to in- fringement.\\nOnce sued, an agency may, like any other accused infringer, argue that the patent is invalid, and the agency faces the same burden of proof as a defendant in any other infringement suit.\\nThe Postal Service lacks only the additional tool of petitioning for the initiation of an administrative proceeding before the Patent Office under the AIA, a process separate from defending an infringe- ment suit.\\nWe see no oddity, however, in Congress’ affording non- governmental actors an expedient route that the Govern- ment does not also enjoy for heading off potential infringement suits.\\nThose other actors face greater and more uncertain risks if they misjudge their right to use technology that is subject to potentially invalid patents.\\nMost notably, §1498 restricts a patent owner who sues the Government to her “reasonable and entire compensation” for the Government’s infringing use;\\nThus, although federal agencies remain subject to damages for impermis- sible uses, they do not face the threat of preliminary in- junctive relief that could suddenly halt their use of a patented invention, and they enjoy a degree of certainty about the extent of their potential liability that ordinary accused infringers do not.\\nBecause federal agencies face lower risks, it is reasonable for Congress to have treated them differently.\\nFinally, excluding federal agencies from the AIA review proceedings avoids the awkward situation that might result from forcing a civilian patent owner (such as Return Mail) to defend the patentability of her invention in an adversarial, adjudicatory proceeding initiated by one federal agency (such as the Postal Service) and overseen by a different federal agency (the Patent Office).\\nWe are therefore unpersuaded that the Government’s exclusion from the AIA review proceedings is sufficiently anomalous to overcome the presumption that the Government is not a “person” under the Act.\\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that a federal agency is not a “person” who may petition for post-issuance re-view under the AIA.\\nBecause infringement suits against the Government must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims—which is not named in the estoppel provisions—the Government might not be precluded by statute from relitigating claims raised before the Patent Office if it were able to institute post-issuance review under the AIA.\\nSee 28 U. S. C. §1498 (a).\\nAlthough Return Mail cites this asymmetry in support of its interpretation, we need not rely on it, because Return Mail already prevails for the reasons given above\\nAt any rate, the practical effect of the estoppel provisions’ potential inapplicability to the Government is uncertain given that this Court has not decided whether common-law estoppel applies in §1498 suits.\\nThe judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is therefore re- versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\nIt is so ordered.\\n']\n"

      "A jury in New Hampshire Superior Court awarded respondent damages in this civil libel action based on one of petitioner's columns in the Laconia Evening Citizen.\n",
      "Respondent alleged that the column contained defamatory falsehoods concerning his performance as Supervisor of the Belknap Country Recreation Area, a facility owned and operated by Belknap County.\n",
      "In the interval between the trial and the decision of petitioner's appeal by the New Hampshire Supreme Court, we decided New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 .\n",
      "We there held that consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments a State cannot award damages to a public official for defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless the official proves actual malicethat the falsehood was published with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of whether it was true or false.\n",
      "The New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed the award, finding New York Times no bar.\n",
      "106 N. H. 26, 203 A. 2d 773.\n",
      "We granted certiorari and requested the parties to brief and argue, in addition to the questions presented in the petition for certiorari, the question whether respondent was a \"public official\" under New York Times and under our decision in Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64 .\n",
      "380 U. S. 941.\n",
      "The Recreation Area was used principally as a ski resort but also for other recreational activities.\n",
      "Respondent was employed by and directly responsible to the Belknap County Commissioners, three elected officials in charge of the county government.\n",
      "During the 1950's, a public controversy developed over the way respondent and the Commissioners operated the Area; some protested that respondent and the Commissioners had not developed the *78 Area's full potential, either as a resort for local residents or as a tourist attraction that might contribute to the county's taxes.\n",
      "some protested that respondent and the Commissioners had not developed the *78 Area's full potential, either as a resort for local residents or as a tourist attraction that might contribute to the county's taxes.\n",
      "The discussion culminated in 1959, when the New Hampshire Legislature enacted a law transferring control of the Area to a special five-man commission.\n",
      "[1] At least in part to give this new regime a fresh start, respondent was discharged.\n",
      "Petitioner regularly contributed an unpaid column to the Laconia Evening Citizen.\n",
      "In it he frequently commented on political matters.\n",
      "As an outspoken proponent of the change in operations at the Recreation Area, petitioner's views were often sharply stated, and he had indicated disagreement with the actions taken by respondent and the County Commissioners.\n",
      "In January 1960, during the first ski season under the new management, some six months after respondent's discharge, petitioner published the column that respondent alleges libeled him.\n",
      "In relevant part, it reads: Been doing a little listening and checking at Belknap Recreation Area and am thunderstruck by what am learning.\n",
      "This year, a year without snow till very late, a year with actually few very major changes in procedure; the difference in cash income simply fantastic, almost unbelievable.\n",
      "\"On any sort of comparative basis, the Area this year is doing literally hundreds of per cent BETTER than last year.\n",
      "\"When consider that last year was excellent snow year, that season started because of more snow, months earlier last year, one can only ponder following question: \"What happened to all the money last year?\n",

      "[Chairman of the new commission] and rest of commission, and Mr. Warner [respondent's replacement as Supervisor] wrought to make such tremendous difference in net cash results?\"\n",
      "The column on its face contains no clearly actionable statement.\n",
      "Although the questions \"What happened to all the money last year?\n",
      "and every other year?\" could be read to imply peculation, they could also be read, in context, merely to praise the present administration.\n",

      "no reference is made to respondent, the three elected commissioners, or anyone else who had a part in the administration of the Area during respondent's tenure Persons familiar with the controversy over the Area might well read it as complimenting the luck or skill of the new management in attracting increased patronage and producing a \"tremendous difference in net cash results\" despite less favorable snow; indeed, witnesses for petitioner testified that they so read the column.\n",
      "indeed, witnesses for petitioner testified that they so read the column.\n",
      "Respondent offered extrinsic proofs to supply a defamatory meaning.\n",
      "These proofs were that the column greatly exaggerated any improvement under the new regime, and that a large part of the community understood it to say that the asserted improvements were not explicable by anything the new management had done.\n",
      "Rather, his witnesses testified, they read the column as imputing mismanagement and peculation during respondent's tenure.\n",
      "Respondent urged two theories to support a recovery based on that imputation.\n",
      "The first was that the jury could award him damages if it found that the column cast suspicion indiscriminately *80 on the small number of persons who composed the former management group, whether or not it found that the imputation of misconduct was specifically made of and concerning him.\n",
      "[2] This theory of recovery was open to respondent under New Hampshire law; the trial judge explicitly instructed the jury that \"an imputation of impropriety or a crime to one or some of a small group that casts suspicion upon all is actionable.\"\n",
      "[3] The question is presented, however, whether that theory of recovery is precluded by our holding in New York Times that, in the absence of sufficient evidence that the attack focused on the plaintiff, an otherwise impersonal attack on governmental operations cannot be utilized to establish a libel of those administering the operations.\n",
      "376 U. S., at 290-292 .\n",
      "The plaintiff in New York Times was one of the three elected Commissioners of the City of Montgomery, Alabama.\n",
      "His duties included the supervision of the police department.\n",
      "The statements in the advertisement upon which he principally relied as referring to him were that \"truckloads of police . . .\n",
      "ringed the Alabama State College Campus\" after a demonstration on the State Capitol steps, and that Dr. Martin Luther King had been \"arrested . . .\n",
      "seven times.\"\n",
      "These statements were false in that although the police had been \"deployed near the campus,\" they had not actually \"ringed\" it and had not gone there in connection with a State Capitol demonstration, and in that Dr. King had been arrested only *81 four times.\n",
      "We held that evidence that Sullivan as Police Commissioner was the supervisory head of the Police Department was constitutionally insufficient to show that the statements about police activity were \"of and concerning\" him; we rejected as inconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments the proposition followed by the Alabama Supreme Court in the case that \"[i]n measuring the performance or deficiencies of . . .\n",
      "groups, praise or criticism is usually attached to the official in complete control of the body,\" we rejected as inconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments the proposition followed by the Alabama Supreme Court in the case that \"[i]n measuring the performance or deficiencies of . . .\n",
      "groups, praise or criticism is usually attached to the official in complete control of the body,\" 273 Ala. 656, 674-675, 144\n",
      "So.\n",
      "2d 25, 39.\n",
      "To allow the jury to connect the statements with Sullivan on that presumption alone was, in our view, to invite the spectre of prosecutions for libel on government, which the Constitution does not tolerate in any form.\n",
      "376 U. S., at 273-276, 290-292 .\n",
      "[4] We held \"that such a proposition may not constitutionally be utilized to establish that an otherwise impersonal attack on governmental operations was a libel of an official responsible for those operations.\"\n",
      "376 U. S., at 292 .\n",
      "There must be evidence showing that the attack was read as specifically directed at the plaintiff.\n",
      "Were the statement at issue in this case an explicit charge that the Commissioners and Baer or the entire Area management were corrupt, we assume without deciding that any member of the identified group might recover.\n",
      "[5] The statement itself might be sufficient evidence that the attack was specifically directed at each individual.\n",
      "Even if a charge and reference were merely implicit, as is alleged here, but a plaintiff could show by extrinsic proofs that the statement referred to him, it would be no defense to a suit by one member of an *82 identifiable group engaged in governmental activity that another was also attacked.\n",
      "These situations are distinguishable from the present case; here, the jury was permitted to infer both defamatory content and reference from the challenged statement itself, although the statement on its face is only an impersonal discussion of government activity.\n",
      "To the extent the trial judge authorized the jury to award respondent a recovery without regard to evidence that the asserted implication of the column was made specifically of and concerning him, we hold that the instruction was erroneous.\n",
      "[6] Here, no explicit charge of peculation was made; no assault on the previous management appears.\n",
      "The jury was permitted to award damages upon a finding merely that respondent was one of a small group acting for an organ of government, only some of whom were implicated, but all of whom were tinged with suspicion.\n",
      "In effect, this permitted the jury to find liability merely on the basis of his relationship to the government agency, the operations of which were the subject of discussion.\n",
      "It is plain that the elected Commissioners, also members of that group, *83 would have been barred from suit on this theory under New York Times.\n",
      "They would be required to show specific reference.\n",
      "Whether or not respondent was a public official, as a member of the group he bears the same burden.\n",
      "[7] A theory that the column cast indiscriminate suspicion on the members of the group responsible for the conduct of this governmental operation is tantamount to a demand for recovery based on libel of government, and therefore is constitutionally insufficient.\n",
      "Since the trial judge's instructions were erroneous in this respect, the judgment must be reversed.\n",
      "Respondent's second theory, supported by testimony of several witnesses, was that the column was read as referring specifically to him, as the \"man in charge\" at the Area, personally responsible for its financial affairs.\n",
      "Even accepting respondent's reading, the column manifestly discusses the conduct of operations of government.\n",
      "[8] The subject matter may have been only of local interest, but at least here, where publication was addressed primarily to the interested community, that fact is constitutionally irrelevant.\n",
      "The question is squarely presented whether the \"public official\" designation under New York Times applies.\n",
      "If it does, it is clear that the jury instructions were improper.\n",
      "Under the instructions, the jury was permitted *84 to find that negligent misstatement of fact would defeat petitioner's privilege.\n",
      "That test was rejected in Garrison, 379 U. S., at 79 , where we said, \"The test which we laid down in New York Times is not keyed to ordinary care; defeasance of the privilege is conditioned, not on mere negligence, but on reckless disregard for the truth.\"\n",
      "The trial court also charged that \"[d]efamatory matter which constitutes comment rather than fact is justified if made without malice and represented fair comment on matters of public interest,\" and defined malice to include \"ill will, evil motive, intention to injure . . . .\"\n",
      "This definition of malice is constitutionally insufficient where discussion of public affairs is concerned; \"[w]e held in New York Times that a public official might be allowed the civil remedy only if he establishes that the utterance was false and that it was made with knowledge of its falsity or in reckless disregard of whether it was false or true.\"\n",
      "Garrison, 379 U. S., at 74 .\n",
      "Turning, then, to the question whether respondent was a \"public official\" within New York Times, we reject at the outset his suggestion that it should be answered by reference to state-law standards.\n",
      "States have developed definitions of \"public official\" for local administrative purposes, not the purposes of a national constitutional protection.\n",
      "[9] If existing state-law standards reflect the purposes of New York Times, this is at best accidental.\n",
      "Our decision in New York Times, moreover, draws its force from the constitutional protections afforded free expression.\n",
      "The standards that set the scope of its principles cannot therefore be such that \"the constitutional limits of free expression in the Nation would vary with state lines.\"\n",
      "Pennekamp v. Florida, 328 U. S. 331 , 335.\n",
      "[10] *85 We remarked in New York Times that we had no occasion \"to determine how far down into the lower ranks of government employees the `public official' designation would extend for purposes of this rule, or otherwise to specify categories of persons who would or would not be included.\"\n",

      "No precise lines need be drawn for the purposes of this case.\n",
      "The motivating force for the decision in New York Times was twofold.\n",
      "We expressed \"a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that [such debate] may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\"\n",
      "376 U. S., at 270 .\n",
      "There is, first, a strong interest in debate on public issues, and, second, a strong interest in debate about those persons who are in a position significantly to influence the resolution of those issues.\n",
      "Criticism of government is at the very center of the constitutionally protected area of free discussion.\n",
      "Criticism of those responsible for government operations must be free, lest criticism of government itself be penalized.\n",
      "t is clear, therefore, that the \"public official\" designation applies at the very least to those among the hierarchy of government employees who have, or appear to the public to have, substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs.\n",

      "This conclusion does not ignore the important social values which underlie the law of defamation.\n",
      "Society has a pervasive and strong interest in preventing and redressing attacks upon reputation.\n",
      "But in cases like the present, there is tension between this interest and the values nurtured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n",
      "The thrust of New York Times is that when interests in public discussion are particularly strong, as they were in that case, the Constitution limits the protections afforded by the law of defamation.\n",
      "Where a position in government has such apparent importance that the public has an independent interest in the qualifications and performance of the person who holds it, beyond the general public interest in the qualifications and performance of all government employees, both elements we identified in New York Times are present [12] and the New York Times malice standards apply.\n",
      "[13] *87 As respondent framed his case, he may have held such a position.\n",
      "Since New York Times had not been decided when his case went to trial, his presentation was not shaped to the \"public official\" issue.\n",
      "He did, however, seek to show that the article referred particularly to him.\n",
      "His theory was that his role in the management of the Area was so prominent and important that the public regarded him as the man responsible for its operations, chargeable with its failures and to be credited with its successes.\n",
      "Thus, to prove the article referred to him, he showed the importance of his role; the same showing, at the least, raises a substantial argument that he was a \"public official.\"\n",
      "[14] The record here, however, leaves open the possibility that respondent could have adduced proofs to bring his claim outside the New York Times rule.\n",
      "Moreover, even if the claim falls within New York Times, the record suggests respondent may be able to present a jury question of malice as there defined.\n",
      "Because the trial here was had before New York Times, we have concluded that we should not foreclose him from attempting retrial of his *88 action.\n",
      "We remark only that, as is the case with questions of privilege generally, it is for the trial judge in the first instance to determine whether the proofs show respondent to be a \"public official.\"\n",
      "[15] The judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the New Hampshire Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n",
      "It is so ordered.\n"
